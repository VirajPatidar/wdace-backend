Ad Feedback Video Ad Feedback How common are Ponzi schemes in crypto? Crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried weighs in 03:59 - Source: CNN Business At least $1 billion of customer funds have vanished from collapsed crypto exchange FTX, according to two people familiar with the matter. The exchange’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried secretly transferred $10 billion of customer funds from FTX to Bankman-Fried’s trading company Alameda Research, the people told Reuters.

Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images The week that took down a crypto behemoth A large portion of that total has since disappeared, they said. One source put the missing amount at about $1.7 billion. The other said the gap was between $1 billion and $2 billion. While it is known that FTX moved customer funds to Alameda, the missing funds are reported here for the first time. The financial hole was revealed in records that Bankman-Fried shared with other senior executives last Sunday, according to the two sources. The records provided an up-to-date account of the situation at the time, they said. Both sources held senior FTX positions until this week and said they were briefed on the company’s finances by top staff. Bahamas-based FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday after a rush of customer withdrawals earlier this week. A rescue deal with rival exchange Binance fell through, precipitating crypto’s highest-profile collapse in recent years. In text messages to Reuters, Bankman-Fried said he “disagreed with the characterization” of the $10 billion transfer. “We didn’t secretly transfer,” he said. “We had confusing internal labeling and misread it,” he added, without elaborating. Asked about the missing funds, Bankman-Fried responded: “???” FTX and Alameda did not respond to requests for comment. In a tweet on Friday, Bankman-Fried said he was “piecing together” what had happened at FTX. “I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week,” he wrote. “I will, soon, write up a more complete post on the play by play.” CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried testifies during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee at Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill December 8, 2021 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong/Getty Images Crypto's white knight lost 94% of his wealth in a single day At the heart of FTX’s problems were losses at Alameda that most FTX executives did not know about, Reuters has previously reported. Customer withdrawals had surged last Sunday after Changpeng Zhao, CEO of giant crypto exchange Binance, said Binance would sell its entire stake in FTX’s digital token, worth at least $580 million, “due to recent revelations.” Four days before, news outlet CoinDesk reported that much of Alameda’s $14.6 billion in assets were held in the token. That Sunday, Bankman-Fried held a meeting with several executives in the Bahamas capital Nassau to calculate how much outside funding he needed to cover FTX’s shortfall, the two people with knowledge of FTX’s finances said. Bankman-Fried confirmed to Reuters that the meeting took place. Bankman-Fried showed several spreadsheets to the heads of the company’s regulatory and legal teams that revealed FTX had moved around $10 billion in client funds from FTX to Alameda, the two people said. The spreadsheets displayed how much money FTX loaned to Alameda and what it was used for, they said. The documents showed that between $1 billion and $2 billion of these funds were not accounted for among Alameda’s assets, the sources said. The spreadsheets did not indicate where this money was moved, and the sources said they don’t know what became of it. In a subsequent examination, FTX legal and finance teams also learned that Bankman-Fried implemented what the two people described as a “backdoor” in FTX’s book-keeping system, which was built using bespoke software. They said the “backdoor” allowed Bankman-Fried to execute commands that could alter the company’s financial records without alerting other people, including external auditors. This set-up meant that the movement of the $10 billion in funds to Alameda did not trigger internal compliance or accounting red flags at FTX, they said.

This year's conference theme is ""The Search for Stability in an Era of Uncertainty, Realignment and Transformation."" Photographer: Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images What's next for crypto as FTX collapse triggers 'Lehman moment'? In his text message to Reuters, Bankman-Fried denied implementing a “backdoor.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating FTX.com’s handling of customer funds, as well as its crypto-lending activities, a source with knowledge of the inquiry told Reuters on Wednesday. The Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are also investigating, the source said. FTX’s bankruptcy marked a stunning reversal for Bankman-Fried. The 30-year-old had set up FTX in 2019 and led it to become one of the largest crypto exchanges, accumulating a personal fortune estimated at nearly $17 billion. FTX was valued in January at $32 billion, with investors including SoftBank and BlackRock. The crisis has sent reverberations through the crypto world, with the price of major coins plummeting. And FTX’s collapse is drawing comparisons to earlier major business meltdowns. On Friday, FTX said it had turned over control of the company to John J. Ray III, the restructuring specialist who handled the liquidation of Enron Corp – one of the largest bankruptcies in history.

The assets could be worth more than $400 million, said crypto risk management firm Elliptic. In a tweet early Saturday , FTX general counsel Ryne Miller said the company “initiated precautionary steps” and moved all its digital assets to cold storage, meaning the crypto wallet is no longer connected to the internet. This follows the announcement Friday that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .

Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images The week that took down a crypto behemoth Elliptic said although the theft is unconfirmed, $473 million in crypto assets were apparently stolen from FTX. The process was “expedited” Friday evening “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions,” Miller said in a tweet . Miller tweeted late Friday that FTX is “investigating abnormalities” regarding wallet movements “related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.” The facts are still unclear and the company will share more information as soon as possible, he added. The stablecoins and other missing tokens are being quickly converted to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, on decentralized exchanges, Elliptic said. Elliptic said it is a common technique used by hackers to prevent their funds from being seized. From FTX Official/YouTube Larry David predicted FTX's implosion FTX, until last week one of the most powerful players in the crypto industry, is experiencing a rapid collapse. Its 30-year-old founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has resigned and he has lost his $16 billion fortune in less than a week . In its bankruptcy filing, FTX said it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets. “I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday . “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg/Getty Images Degrowth: A dangerous idea or the answer to the world's biggest crisis?

Ad Feedback Video Ad Feedback This crypto collapse has a human cost 02:15 - Source: CNN New York CNN — The reeling crypto industry faces a 2008-style crisis that will lead to a much-needed regulatory crackdown, crypto CEO Changpeng Zhao warned on Friday. “It’s devastating for the industry. A lot of consumer confidence is shaken. We’ve been set back a few years,” Zhao, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said during a conference in Indonesia. The Binance boss, known as CZ, was speaking amidst the stunning implosion of rival FTX, which filed for bankruptcy just hours later. “We’ve just seen another very big player going down,” said Zhao, who noted this collapse follows the downfall of Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrows Capital and other crypto firms. Zhao was a key player in the downfall of FTX. Binance reached a tentative rescue deal with FTX earlier this week, but that transaction almost immediately fell apart, paving the way for Friday’s bankruptcy filing and the resignation of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The moderator noted the crypto turmoil feels much like the 2008 global financial crisis, which brought down Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and other leading Wall Street players. “That’s probably an accurate analogy,” Zhao said. He urged regulators to look beyond just anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) rules and focus instead on the operations, business models and reserves of exchanges like FTX. “Regulators, rightfully, will scrutinize this industry much, much harder, which is probably a good thing to be honest,” Zhao said. “Short-term, it’s very painful for retail investors…We feel that pain. But longer-term, this is another wakeup call to say, ‘Look, we are in a new industry. There are a lot of risks and we need to learn how to deal with these risks.” Zhao also detailed his interactions with FTX, saying his firm decided to dump its holdings in FTT – an illiquid token backed by FTX – after a CoinDesk report raised questions about the balance sheet of FTX’s sister hedge fund. “This problem wasn’t created in the last three days,” Zhao said, adding the trouble has been there for much longer. The Binance CEO accused FTX of “misappropriating” user funds. Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old crypto wunderkind behind FTX, said on Friday he’s “really sorry” about what happened at his firm. “I’m piecing together all of the details,” Bankman-Fried wrote on Twitter, “but I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg/Getty Images Degrowth: A dangerous idea or the answer to the world's biggest crisis?

Welcome to 'Nightcap' 15:24 Now playing - Source: CNN Business New York CNN Business — In an abrupt reversal, cryptocurrency exchange Binance pulled out of a deal to acquire its embattled rival FTX, saying the company’s problems were “beyond our control or ability to help.” Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, said it reviewed FTX’s finances as part of the due diligence process, and it cited reports of “mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations” in announcing the deal was off. The reversal is the latest twist in a dramatic and fast-moving saga involving the crypto world’s most powerful players. It also marks a stunning fall for Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old rock star of the industry who founded FTX in 2019. Bankman-Fried, known to insiders as SBF, regularly drew comparisons to investing icons like Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan as he engineered a series of bailouts to struggling crypto firms earlier this year. He has appeared in ads alongside celebrities like Gisele Bündchen, part of a campaign to bring crypto into the mainstream. Without a bailout, FTX is poised to collapse, along with the rest of Bankman-Fried’s vast crypto empire. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bankman-Fried told investors Wednesday that he needs emergency funding to cover a shortfall of up to $8 billion due to withdrawal requests received in recent days. Virtually all digital assets sank Wednesday over the turmoil at FTX. Bitcoin sank below $16,000, its lowest level in two years, after Binance confirmed it would not buy FTX. The crypto currency has fallen more than 75% from its all-time high near $69,000 a year ago. Ether, the second most popular token, fell about 13% to $1,137 — also off 75% from its record high. Representatives for Binance and FTX didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. Even for assets known for their volatility, it’s been a brutal week. The FTX saga escalated over the weekend, when Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, said his company would liquidate its holdings in FTX as speculation swirled about the company’s financial health. In essence, that forced a $580 million capital call that Bankman-Fried didn’t have the liquidity to meet. Despite bad blood between Bankman-Fried and Zhao, the rivals appeared to come together on a deal that stunned the crypto world on Tuesday, when Binance said it would acquire FTX pending due diligence. Still, investors worried about the deal coming together and promptly sold off digital assets of all stripes. According to Bloomberg, the meltdown of FTX is already under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commision. The outlet reported that the regulators are investigating whether FTX properly handled customer funds, citing people familiar with the probe. A spokesperson for the SEC said the commission does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation. The CFTC declined to comment. —CNN Business’ Matt Egan contributed to this article.

Bitcoin has lost more than half its value in 2022. Now hovering around $23,000, the price of a single bitcoin has plunged more than 65% below last year’s all-time high of nearly $70,000. The value of all cryptos has tumbled from about $2.2 trillion at the end of 2021 to a little more than $1 trillion currently. Bitcoin, the world’s biggest crypto, makes up about 42% of the total market, but 2022 has been just as terrible for the owners of other crypto-related assets such as Coinbase . The brokerage’s stock has plummeted 75% so far this year. Shares of rival Robinhood have lost half their value. There are hopes that the worst for crypto might be over. Bitcoin has gained more than 15% in the past week, and two other top cryptos have surged even more. Solana is up more than 35% in the past seven days while ethereum, or ether for short, has climbed nearly 45%. Ether, the second-most valuable crypto, is widely used to finance purchases of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs , the digital assets that have taken the collectibles world by storm. Bitcoins with US tax form 1040. Golden Bitcoin on tax form. Tax form pay concept Adobe Stock video Here's why bitcoin's drop has investors worried Coinbase has rallied as well, and was up 9% on Monday. Software company MicroStrategy (MSTR) , which had nearly 130,000 bitcoins on its balance sheet as of June 30, has soared more than 35% in the past five days. The crypto comeback could be validation for the sector’s biggest supporters. At the same time, it should also serve as a reminder that the nascent market is likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Expect more volatility “We will see a longer-term rally in the digital assets sector, but I wouldn’t get too excited yet,” said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group. “This is still an emerging market.” Kruger said that bitcoin’s rally has lagged the sharper upward moves in ether and other smaller cryptos, and remains a concern for the short term. The broader group of cryptocurrencies and stocks may not enjoy a more meaningful recovery until there is “a more healthy bounce” in bitcoin, he added. So all the hype about bitcoin being the digital equivalent of gold is just that: hype. As an asset, bitcoin behaves much more like volatile tech stocks rather than the far more stable commodities such as gold or government-backed currencies like the dollar and euro.

If that’s the case, only the strongest cryptos will survive and thrive. “Crypto has seen a dotcom era-like run,” when a lot of great ideas and companies were created, Adam Grealish, head of investments at wealth management fintech Altruist, said in an email. But a number of not-so-great ideas and companies also were launched, he added. The same scenario will likely apply to crypto. “With tougher markets, companies in weaker positions and with weaker business models will feel a lot of pressure,” Grealish said. Don’t tell that to the crypto bulls. The broader rally is lifting shares of nearly all companies with ties to the industry. Several crypto mining firms, which use computers to solve complex mathematical equations in order to generate new bitcoins, have moved sharply higher in recent days. Marathon Digital (MARA) rose 21% Monday and is up more than 50% in the past week. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) has surged more than 40% in the past five days while Hive Blockchain (HVBTF) and Bitfarms are each up about 25%. So have bitcoin, ether and top crypto stocks finally hit bottom? There are some hopeful signs. Winners and losers Two banks that provide crypto-backed loans and offer digital currency deposits, Silvergate Capital (SI) and Signature Bank (SBNY) , each reported earnings and revenue Tuesday that topped Wall Street’s forecasts. It also appears that the sector’s turmoil has created a shakeout of winners and losers among both publicly traded companies and startups. Crypto lender Celsius was forced to file for bankruptcy earlier this month. But privately held crypto giant FTX continues to thrive, and now has a valuation of $32 billion. CryptoCom/YouTube Welcome to the crypto Super Bowl FTX recently agreed to provide a line of credit to struggling crypto firm BlockFi, and the company’s billionaire CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, has talked about using FTX’s financial strength to bail out other floundering crypto companies as well. Bankman-Fried also has a stake in Robinhood , and there was recent chatter that FTX might want to buy the struggling brokerage firm. Bankman-Fried denied those reports to CNN Business.

Ad Feedback An employee preparing items for delivery for the Singles Day shopping festival at a logistics center in Nanjing, a city in China's eastern Jiangsu province, on Nov. 10, 2022. Stringer/Getty Images Hong Kong CNN Business — China’s Singles Day, the world’s biggest annual shopping event , is known for regularly smashing sales records. This year’s bonanza, which wraps up on Friday and is led by internet titans Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) , will likely be no exception: Analysts expect it to rack up 1 trillion yuan ($140.8 billion) in sales for the first time. Singles Day usually eclipses two of the world’s most popular sales events — Black Friday and Cyber Monday — combined. The festival, also known as “Double 11,” is pegged to China’s unofficial, anti-Valentine’s Day holiday that celebrates people not in romantic relationships. The date — 11.11 — was chosen since written out, it appears as four ones, or singles. But the projected tally would represent just a small uptick — about 5% — on the 952.3 billion yuan ($134.2 billion) notched up last year. That already marked a historic slowdown in growth. Experts have flagged two major factors behind the loss of momentum this year: Competition is up, and consumer confidence is down. The focus, they said, has shifted from generating massive sales to keeping customers happy, particularly in an uncertain environment. Xiaofeng Wang, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester, told CNN Business that she believed Singles Day sales would cross the trillion-yuan mark this week. However, “it’s just impossible to sustain high growth year by year,” she said. “Eventually, [companies] know it’s not a sustainable strategy. That’s why they want to focus on customer experience and customer loyalty.” A ‘gloomier outlook’ Sales growth had already been slowing in recent years. In 2021, the tally for Singles Day rose 13%, “the smallest advance ever,” according to an analysis by Bain & Company . Deborah Weinswig, CEO and founder of Coresight Research, a global advisory and research firm specializing in retail and technology, said it was tough to compare annual growth as the time frame of the event had changed. “When Alibaba initially launched 11.11, the sales period lasted 24 hours,” she noted. Now, the event can stretch out to roughly two weeks or more, depending on each retailer. Weinswig added that vendors were also facing a slew of hurdles this time, tied to the broader economy. “Given China’s weak retail sales this year, declining consumer confidence, unrelenting zero-Covid policy, and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, 11.11 festival growth could slow, as consumers are more cautious about making discretionary purchases,” Weinswig told CNN Business. “Additionally, increasing government regulation of the tech and live-streaming industries could hurt sales growth this year.” E-commerce livestreamer Austin Li Jiaqi attends a public-welfare livestreaming ceremony on September 23, 2021 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China. VCG/Getty Imags China's 'Lipstick King' returns to live-streaming show after mysterious three-month disappearance According to a Bain survey , 34% of customers returning from Singles Day last year said they planned to spend less. “Only 24% said they were planning to spend more — a markedly gloomier outlook than in 2021,” the consultancy noted. Bain experts added that while they, too, could see the festival crossing 1 trillion yuan in sales, “the relatively modest growth needed for that feat is far from guaranteed.” An evolving sector China is undergoing historic economic challenges as it continues to grapple with the impact of a stringent “zero Covid” policy and a faltering global economy. As a result, consumers have been pulling back. Last month, data showed that Chinese retail sales rose 2.5% in September, significantly down from the 5.4% jump recorded in August. This Singles Day, consumers are also affected by “shopping festival fatigue,” due to an increase in online sale events that has led customers to “stock up throughout the year” rather than saving up for large, one-time purchases, according to Kelly Liu, the Shanghai-based head of Bain’s Greater China retail practice.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo/File Photo Aly Song/Reuters Tesla's stock sinks after cutting prices on cars in China Even so, the event will remain important for retailers, Liu added. Wang, the Forrester analyst, said that companies were responding to the spike in competition. Alibaba, for instance, has extended a window for customers to claim a “lowest-price guarantee,” while offering free shipping for returns, she noted. Liu also said that some retailers had “started shipping early to avoid congestion” caused by Covid-related supply chain snags. Singles Day “isn’t going anywhere,” concluded James Yang, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain. “However, in terms of its share of sales, this will likely decline,” he added. “This isn’t necessarily negative; it points towards a market that is maturing with an evolving consumer base.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg/Getty Images Degrowth: A dangerous idea or the answer to the world's biggest crisis?

But it appears that didn’t happen. And investors saw red on their trading screens Wednesday. Stocks ended the day broadly lower, with the Dow plunging more than 645 points, or 2%. Merck (MRK) was the only Dow stock to finish Wednesday higher…and barely so. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 2.1% and 2.5% respectively. One stock in particular that had been surging in anticipation of a sweeping victory for the GOP got hit hard Wednesday. Digital World Acquisition Corp. , a so-called blank check, special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that is hoping to merge with former President Donald Trump’s media company , plunged about 20%. The stock had skyrocketed more than 65% Monday. The market rallied sharply during the past three days following a historic surge for stocks in October. That was due in part to expectations of a convincing victory for Republicans that could give the party control of one or both chambers of Congress — a development that could lead to more investor-friendly gridlock . Lee County voters wait in line to cast their ballots at Wa-Ke Hatchee Recreation Center in Fort Myers, Fla, on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2022. After the area was devastated and thousands were left displaced by Hurricane Ian, Lee County extended their early voting period and permitted voters on Election Day to cast their ballot in any of the dozen open polling places. Rebecca Blackwell/AP Markets are in trouble. Election results won't change that But it’s not yet clear if Democrats will actually lose their majority in either chamber. “The market expected a different outcome. There may be disappointment among investors that there won’t be a more robust check on the Biden administration,” said Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist with Stifel. “There will still be gridlock, but there is confusion and a lack of clarity.” Gridlock isn’t great as inflation remains in focus Gardner said the chance of any meaningful new stimulus bills getting passed between now and the 2024 presidential elections are “very slim” -— even if the economy slips into a recession. The best that the market might be able to hope for is that Washington can pass a federal budget and steer clear of more drama about lifting the debt ceiling. “The two parties don’t see it in their best interest to cooperate with the other side,” Gardner said. That may not necessarily be good news for the longer-term though. “Right now you want the decision making in Washington to be quick, in an environment with slowing growth and concerns about a recession rising,” said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro. Still, as the midterm dust settles, investors may now shift their attention back to inflation and the economy. The government will report the October consumer price index figures Thursday morning. Economists expect that CPI rose 8% in the past 12 months. That’s still historically high, but it would be a slight pullback from the 8.2% increase in September. Investors are hoping that if inflation continues to cool, the Fed may be able to finally slow the pace of interest rate hikes following four consecutive increases of three-quarters of a point. With that in mind, investors probably should focus more on the economy and corporate earnings — especially since history shows that stocks have tended to go up following elections , regardless of which party is in power. “Elections are a very important part of the puzzle, but it’s only one of many factors,” said Kevin Green, senior researcher at Dimensional Fund Advisors. “Markets have performed remarkably similar during periods of a Republican or Democratic controlled Congress.” Still, there are some concerns about weaker profits as the economy slows. Shares of Disney (DIS) , gaming company Roblox and electric vehicle startup Lucid all plunged between 13% and 21% following weak results. Facebook owner Meta Platforms also confirmed a major round of layoffs …but the stock rallied more than 5% on the news.

Musk’s Tesla stock sales, totaling 19.5 million shares, have been widely anticipated ever since the Tesla CEO reached a deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion . Musk had sold blocks of Tesla shares worth a total of $15.4 billion earlier this year since his deal to buy Twitter was announced. Twitter confirmed Musk bought the social media company October 27, but he waited until November 4 to start selling additional Tesla shares. He also sold blocks of Tesla stock on Monday and Tuesday this week, according to filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission late Tuesday night. It’s not clear if the money Musk raised went toward the Twitter purchase, or to support losses at Twitter since he took over. Musk disclosed last week that Twitter has seen a “ massive drop in revenue ,” as a growing number of advertisers pause spending on the platform in the wake of his takeover of the company. He blamed “activist groups” pressuring advertisers for the loss of ad dollars. Twitter lost $270 million in the quarter ending June 30, well before Musk took over and advertisers began to flee. It had only $2.7 billion of cash on hand on its balance sheet as of June 30. He has announced plans to charge users $8 a month to have verified accounts, and also announced deep staff cuts . Musk’s two weeks of ownership of Twitter have been a “debacle of epic proportions,” said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities. Although it’s possible that the money from Musk’s sale of Twitter sales the last two week may have gone toward paying off some short-term financing used to close the Twitter deal, it can’t be ruled out that it was made necessary by big losses at Twitter. “The more he gets into Twitter, the more it becomes a quicksand type of deal,” said Ives. Tesla’s falling stock This is not the best time to be selling Tesla shares, which have lost 46% of their value so far this year on disappointing sales caused by supply chain problems. Musk received an average price of $202.52 for the Tesla shares he sold since the Twitter deal closed, which is down 10% just since he closed on his deal to buy Twitter. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell 1.5% in premarket trading Wednesday. The company is facing growing competition in the electric vehicle market from established automakers such as Volkswagen , Ford and General Motors . And some investors have expressed concerns that Musk will be too distracted by his purchase of Twitter to give enough attention to addressing Tesla’s problems. “Tesla investors are exacerbated by this never ending Twitter albatross,” said Ives. “Musk needs to look in the mirror and end this constant merry-go-round of Twitter overhang on the Tesla story with his focus back on the golden child Tesla which needs his time more than ever.” Musk’s stock sales These three most recent blocks of Tesla stock sales represent only 4% of the shares that Musk owns outright through a trust, and less than 3% of his holdings if options that he has to buy additional shares are included. Musk agreed to buy Twitter (TWTR) in April, shortly after filings showed he had purchased 73 million shares , or about a 9% stake, for $2.6 billion. The purchases made him the company’s largest shareholder. Soon after the deal was announced, he disclosed he had sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen as a first step to raise the cash he would need to complete the purchase of Twitter. Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduces the Cybertruck at Tesla's design studio Thursday, Nov. 21, 2019, in Hawthorne, Calif. Ringo H.W. Chiu/AP Elon Musk's wrecking ball is hard at work inside Twitter Even after Musk announced a change of heart and fought a lawsuit brought by Twitter to force him to buy the company, he continued to sell Tesla shares. Filings in August showed he had sold an additional $6.9 billion worth of Tesla shares. Musk’s filings did not disclose the reason for those earlier stock sales. But after someone on Twitter asked him if he was done selling Tesla shares, he responded “Yes” and then pointed to the possibility of being forced to buy Twitter as the reason for those sales. Since Musk’s earlier Tesla sales, shares of Tesla have split three-for-one , meaning he needed to sell three times as many shares in order to raise as much cash. But his holdings of Tesla shares also tripled due to the split. Before his interest in Twitter, Musk rarely sold shares of Tesla stock, primarily selling shares necessary to pay taxes when exercising stock options. He sold a total of 15.7 million pre-split shares at the end of 2021, netting a total of $16.4 billion, because he had to exercise stock options or risk having them expire. He likely ended up with a tax bill of more than $10 billion. But even after paying that tax bill and the cost to exercise those options, he likely had roughly $5 billion left over . He may have used some of that cash to buy his initial Twitter stake. These latest sales represent the lowest price at which Musk has sold Tesla shares recently, off about 30% from his sales in April and August when adjusted for the Tesla stock split since then, and down 42% from what he received when he sold shares in late 2021. – CNN Business’ Clare Duffy and Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg/Getty Images Degrowth: A dangerous idea or the answer to the world's biggest crisis?

New York CNN Business — Stocks surged on Thursday in their best day since 2020 after a key inflation indicator came in softer than expected. Investors broke out their party hats as they interpreted the report to mean that peak inflation may finally be behind us. That means the Federal Reserve could be less aggressive with its rate hikes. But Wall Street’s memory is short: Less than two weeks ago Fed Chair Jerome Powell unambiguously said rates would remain higher for longer. Investors may be in for another letdown as sustained price pressures in housing, wages and energy mean the central bank still has a long way to go in its battle against inflation. What’s happening: The Consumer Price Index rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, a much slower pace of increase than the 8% economists had expected and the lowest annual inflation reading since January. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank still has “ some ways to go ” in its battle to tame inflation, sentiment is growing that the Fed may pivot and ease its current regime of historically high rate hikes to fight growing prices. As of Thursday afternoon, markets were pricing in an 80% chance of a half-point rate increase at the Fed’s December policymaking meeting. That would represent a deceleration after a run of four consecutive hikes of three-quarters of a percentage point. But investors have a knack for getting their hopes up about a central bank pivot only to be crushed by another piece of negative data or hawkish messaging from a Fed official. “The market’s short-term reaction may be strong, but this is only one month’s data,” warned Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management. “This entire year has seen the market careen from one narrative to the next. While the October CPI data may help to soften the Fed’s trajectory a bit, it would take a lot more in coming months for the Fed to make an actual dovish pivot rather than stick to its ‘higher for longer’ recent messaging.” The inflation rate still remains far above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and the pace at which inflation is declining is still very slow. “Like an athlete running in a marathon, the Federal Reserve’s attempt to bring inflation down toward its 2% target requires some patience, but importantly, moving forward matters even if it’s early on in the race,” said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income. It’s not all bad news: The first mile in a marathon matters. The latest report bodes well for the economy and could mean that a soft or soft-ish landing, where inflation eases without recession, is still achievable. That’s also good for markets. “If the Fed doesn’t have to tighten as aggressively, the economy will weaken less, and headwinds for stocks will be smaller,” wrote Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank in a note. What’s next: This is just one report in a crowded landscape of economic data. But if inflation continues to moderate in November, that could be enough to convince the Fed to ease its rate of hiking. Nowhere for investors to hide It’s been a terrible year for cryptocurrency. The value of Bitcoin has dropped nearly 75% since last November and the spectacular implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX , a so-called unicorn startup that was recently valued at $32 billion, is just the latest bit of bad news for investors in digital currencies. Crypto-advocates were hoping that rising interest and inflation rates would drive investors away from the dollar and into alternative assets like gold and Bitcoin. They’ve been in for a rude awakening this year, reports my colleague Paul R. La Monica. Unfortunately, those assets have gotten hit just like stocks and bonds, proving there really is no place to hide in a market where worries about rate hikes and recession reign supreme. Gold prices have also fallen this year, though not nearly at the same rate as digital currencies. They’re down by about 6%. A crypto thaw: Bitcoin soared through the Covid-era on the wings of near-zero interest rates, stimulus cash and a big influx of investors from large-scale institutions. It reached a record high of nearly $70,000 in November. Then, central banks started raising rates to fight inflation, and the dollar strengthened significantly, seducing investors as the ultimate safe haven. At the same time, the economy began to sour and those new investors who still viewed bitcoin as a risky asset exited in droves. This isn’t the first time that there has been a so-called crypto winter. Bitcoin prices have been notoriously volatile over the past few years, but they have still done better than many major stock market indexes. Just look at bitcoin prices since the summer of 2020. They’re up more than 80%…even though it has been far from a smooth ride. The Nasdaq, by way of comparison, is only up about 1% from July 2020 levels. “Bitcoin and ethereum went straight up and down but they have still gained a lot from mid-2020. Over that longer time horizon, digital assets are still outperforming tech stocks,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a firm that specializes in crypto. More mortgage madness Bad news for potential home buyers: Mortgage rates have once again jumped back above 7%, after a slight drop last week. Mortgage rates have risen throughout most of 2022, spurred by the Federal Reserve’s regime of interest rate hikes. Last week, the Fed announced it would raise interest rates by another 75 basis points, the sixth rate increase this year and the fourth-consecutive hike of that size. “The housing market is the most interest-rate sensitive segment of the economy, and the impact rates have on homebuyers continues to evolve,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Home sales have declined significantly and, as we approach year-end, they are not expected to improve.” The bottom line: With mortgage rates up four percentage points from a year ago, buyers’ purchasing power has plummeted. That has pushed many buyers out of the market and those who remain may need to look at a lower price point or make compromises on the location, size, or condition of a house in order to find one that is affordable. Because of this drastic change in the cost to finance a home, sales have dropped for eight months running, according to the National Association of Realtors. A survey from Fannie Mae showed that only 16% of people think this is a good time to buy a home, a record low.

The Consumer Price Index rose 7.7% for the year ending in October, a much slower pace of increase than the 8% economists had expected and the lowest annual inflation reading since January. The stock market skyrocketed on the news , with Dow futures surging by more than 800 points on hopes the Fed would dial back its aggressive rate hikes. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the central bank still has “some ways to go” in its battle to tame inflation, sentiment is clearly growing that the Fed may be able to tap the brakes ever so slightly. Fed funds futures are now pricing in a nearly 80% chance of a half-point increase, at the Fed’s December policymaking meeting, smaller than the three-quarters of a percentage point increases the Fed announced at the previous four meetings. “Today’s CPI report shows inflation is moving in the right direction,” said Eric Merlis, managing director and co-head of global markets at Citizens. “The report provides ammunition for the Fed to begin pricing in sub-75-basis-point tightenings. This will be a welcome development for the Fed.” Peak inflation? On a monthly basis, prices rose by 0.4%. That’s on par with the previous month’s increase of 0.4%. Economists were anticipating the monthly figure to grow, given energy prices marched upward in October amid a move by OPEC+ to slash oil production and ongoing uncertainty in Russia’s war in Ukraine. There also appeared to be some gains made in a measurement watched even more closely by the Fed: Core CPI, which excludes the more volatile categories of food and energy, measured 6.3% for the year ended in October, down from the 6.6% increase posted in September. Month-on-month, core CPI increased 0.3%. It had logged monthly increases of 0.6% in both August and September. Shutterstock How does inflation affect my standard of living? This period of high inflation is likely reaching an inflection point, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. “While I expect the Fed to lift the policy rate by 50 basis points at its December meeting, the supersize rate hikes are likely now in the rearview mirror,” he said. Thursday’s CPI report marked an improvement from a stretch of hotter-than-expected inflation readings, but the pervasiveness of price increases remains problematic for consumers, businesses and the Biden administration. “Any meaningful relief for household budgets is still somewhere over the horizon,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “In categories that are necessities — shelter, food, and energy — we continue to see large and consistent increases,” he said. “The areas posting declines are for the most part either irregular or more discretionary in nature — airfare, used cars, and apparel.” Year over year, shelter prices are up 6.9%, food prices are up 10.9%, and energy prices are up 17.6%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs for staples such as eggs (up 43%), bread (up 14.8%) and milk (up 14.%) remain elevated. —CNN Business’ Matt Egan and Paul R. La Monica contributed to this report.

Deep learning vs. machine learning How deep learning works Deep learning applications Deep learning hardware requirements Deep learning and IBM Jump to ... What is deep learning? Deep learning vs. machine learning How deep learning works Deep learning applications Deep learning hardware requirements Deep learning and IBM Deep Learning Deep learning attempts to mimic the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—enabling systems to cluster data and make predictions with incredible accuracy. What is deep learning? Deep learning is a subset of machine learning , which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy. Deep learning drives many artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services that improve automation, performing analytical and physical tasks without human intervention. Deep learning technology lies behind everyday products and services (such as digital assistants, voice-enabled TV remotes, and credit card fraud detection) as well as emerging technologies (such as self-driving cars). Deep learning vs. machine learning If deep learning is a subset of machine learning, how do they differ? Deep learning distinguishes itself from classical machine learning by the type of data that it works with and the methods in which it learns. Machine learning algorithms leverage structured, labeled data to make predictions—meaning that specific features are defined from the input data for the model and organized into tables. This doesn’t necessarily mean that it doesn’t use unstructured data; it just means that if it does, it generally goes through some pre-processing to organize it into a structured format. Deep learning eliminates some of data pre-processing that is typically involved with machine learning. These algorithms can ingest and process unstructured data, like text and images, and it automates feature extraction, removing some of the dependency on human experts. For example, let’s say that we had a set of photos of different pets, and we wanted to categorize by “cat”, “dog”, “hamster”, et cetera. Deep learning algorithms can determine which features (e.g. ears) are most important to distinguish each animal from another. In machine learning, this hierarchy of features is established manually by a human expert. Then, through the processes of gradient descent and backpropagation, the deep learning algorithm adjusts and fits itself for accuracy, allowing it to make predictions about a new photo of an animal with increased precision. Machine learning and deep learning models are capable of different types of learning as well, which are usually categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning utilizes labeled datasets to categorize or make predictions; this requires some kind of human intervention to label input data correctly. In contrast, unsupervised learning doesn’t require labeled datasets, and instead, it detects patterns in the data, clustering them by any distinguishing characteristics. Reinforcement learning is a process in which a model learns to become more accurate for performing an action in an environment based on feedback in order to maximize the reward. For a deeper dive on the nuanced differences between the different technologies, see "" AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference? "" For a closer look at the specific differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, see "" Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference? "" How deep learning works Deep learning neural networks, or artificial neural networks, attempts to mimic the human brain through a combination of data inputs, weights, and bias. These elements work together to accurately recognize, classify, and describe objects within the data. Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, each building upon the previous layer to refine and optimize the prediction or categorization. This progression of computations through the network is called forward propagation. The input and output layers of a deep neural network are called visible layers. The input layer is where the deep learning model ingests the data for processing, and the output layer is where the final prediction or classification is made. Another process called backpropagation uses algorithms, like gradient descent, to calculate errors in predictions and then adjusts the weights and biases of the function by moving backwards through the layers in an effort to train the model. Together, forward propagation and backpropagation allow a neural network to make predictions and correct for any errors accordingly. Over time, the algorithm becomes gradually more accurate. The above describes the simplest type of deep neural network in the simplest terms. However, deep learning algorithms are incredibly complex, and there are different types of neural networks to address specific problems or datasets. For example, Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), used primarily in computer vision and image classification applications, can detect features and patterns within an image, enabling tasks, like object detection or recognition. In 2015, a CNN bested a human in an object recognition challenge for the first time. Recurrent neural network (RNNs) are typically used in natural language and speech recognition applications as it leverages sequential or times series data. Deep learning applications Real-world deep learning applications are a part of our daily lives, but in most cases, they are so well-integrated into products and services that users are unaware of the complex data processing that is taking place in the background. Some of these examples include the following: Law enforcement Deep learning algorithms can analyze and learn from transactional data to identify dangerous patterns that indicate possible fraudulent or criminal activity. Speech recognition, computer vision, and other deep learning applications can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of investigative analysis by extracting patterns and evidence from sound and video recordings, images, and documents, which helps law enforcement analyze large amounts of data more quickly and accurately. Financial services Financial institutions regularly use predictive analytics to drive algorithmic trading of stocks, assess business risks for loan approvals, detect fraud, and help manage credit and investment portfolios for clients. Customer service Many organizations incorporate deep learning technology into their customer service processes. Chatbots —used in a variety of applications, services, and customer service portals—are a straightforward form of AI. Traditional chatbots use natural language and even visual recognition, commonly found in call center-like menus. However, more sophisticated chatbot solutions attempt to determine, through learning, if there are multiple responses to ambiguous questions. Based on the responses it receives, the chatbot then tries to answer these questions directly or route the conversation to a human user. Virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant extends the idea of a chatbot by enabling speech recognition functionality. This creates a new method to engage users in a personalized way. Healthcare The healthcare industry has benefited greatly from deep learning capabilities ever since the digitization of hospital records and images. Image recognition applications can support medical imaging specialists and radiologists, helping them analyze and assess more images in less time. Deep learning hardware requirements Deep learning requires a tremendous amount of computing power. High performance graphical processing units (GPUs) are ideal because they can handle a large volume of calculations in multiple cores with copious memory available. However, managing multiple GPUs on-premises can create a large demand on internal resources and be incredibly costly to scale. Deep learning and IBM For decades now, IBM has been a pioneer in the development of AI technologies and deep learning, highlighted by the development of IBM Watson , IBM's AI chatbot . One of the earliest accomplishments in deep learning technology, Watson is now a trusted solution for enterprises looking to apply advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques to their systems using a proven tiered approach to AI adoption and implementation. Watson uses the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) framework and IBM’s DeepQA software to make powerful deep learning capabilities available to applications.

By Jason Brownlee on August 16, 2019 in Deep Learning Tweet Tweet Share Share Last Updated on August 14, 2020 Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks . If you are just starting out in the field of deep learning or you had some experience with neural networks some time ago, you may be confused. I know I was confused initially and so were many of my colleagues and friends who learned and used neural networks in the 1990s and early 2000s. The leaders and experts in the field have ideas of what deep learning is and these specific and nuanced perspectives shed a lot of light on what deep learning is all about. In this post, you will discover exactly what deep learning is by hearing from a range of experts and leaders in the field. Kick-start your project with my new book Deep Learning With Python , including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s dive in. What is Deep Learning? Kiran Foster Deep Learning is Large Neural Networks Andrew Ng from Coursera and Chief Scientist at Baidu Research formally founded Google Brain that eventually resulted in the productization of deep learning technologies across a large number of Google services. He has spoken and written a lot about what deep learning is and is a good place to start. In early talks on deep learning, Andrew described deep learning in the context of traditional artificial neural networks. In the 2013 talk titled “ Deep Learning, Self-Taught Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning ” he described the idea of deep learning as: Using brain simulations, hope to: – Make learning algorithms much better and easier to use. – Make revolutionary advances in machine learning and AI. I believe this is our best shot at progress towards real AI Later his comments became more nuanced. The core of deep learning according to Andrew is that we now have fast enough computers and enough data to actually train large neural networks. When discussing why now is the time that deep learning is taking off at ExtractConf 2015 in a talk titled “ What data scientists should know about deep learning “, he commented: very large neural networks we can now have and … huge amounts of data that we have access to He also commented on the important point that it is all about scale. That as we construct larger neural networks and train them with more and more data, their performance continues to increase. This is generally different to other machine learning techniques that reach a plateau in performance. for most flavors of the old generations of learning algorithms … performance will plateau. … deep learning … is the first class of algorithms … that is scalable. … performance just keeps getting better as you feed them more data He provides a nice cartoon of this in his slides: Why Deep Learning? Slide by Andrew Ng , all rights reserved. Finally, he is clear to point out that the benefits from deep learning that we are seeing in practice come from supervised learning. From the 2015 ExtractConf talk, he commented: almost all the value today of deep learning is through supervised learning or learning from labeled data Earlier at a talk to Stanford University titled “ Deep Learning ” in 2014 he made a similar comment: one reason that deep learning has taken off like crazy is because it is fantastic at supervised learning Andrew often mentions that we should and will see more benefits coming from the unsupervised side of the tracks as the field matures to deal with the abundance of unlabeled data available . Jeff Dean is a Wizard and Google Senior Fellow in the Systems and Infrastructure Group at Google and has been involved and perhaps partially responsible for the scaling and adoption of deep learning within Google. Jeff was involved in the Google Brain project and the development of large-scale deep learning software DistBelief and later TensorFlow . In a 2016 talk titled “ Deep Learning for Building Intelligent Computer Systems ” he made a comment in the similar vein, that deep learning is really all about large neural networks. When you hear the term deep learning, just think of a large deep neural net. Deep refers to the number of layers typically and so this kind of the popular term that’s been adopted in the press. I think of them as deep neural networks generally. He has given this talk a few times, and in a modified set of slides for the same talk , he highlights the scalability of neural networks indicating that results get better with more data and larger models, that in turn require more computation to train. Results Get Better With More Data, Larger Models, More Compute Slide by Jeff Dean , All Rights Reserved. Deep Learning is Hierarchical Feature Learning In addition to scalability, another often cited benefit of deep learning models is their ability to perform automatic feature extraction from raw data, also called feature learning . Yoshua Bengio is another leader in deep learning although began with a strong interest in the automatic feature learning that large neural networks are capable of achieving. He describes deep learning in terms of the algorithms ability to discover and learn good representations using feature learning. In his 2012 paper titled “ Deep Learning of Representations for Unsupervised and Transfer Learning ” he commented: Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features An elaborated perspective of deep learning along these lines is provided in his 2009 technical report titled “ Learning deep architectures for AI ” where he emphasizes the importance the hierarchy in feature learning. Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. Automatically learning features at multiple levels of abstraction allow a system to learn complex functions mapping the input to the output directly from data, without depending completely on human-crafted features. In the soon to be published book titled “ Deep Learning ” co-authored with Ian Goodfellow and Aaron Courville, they define deep learning in terms of the depth of the architecture of the models. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. For this reason, we call this approach to AI deep learning. This is an important book and will likely become the definitive resource for the field for some time. The book goes on to describe multilayer perceptrons as an algorithm used in the field of deep learning, giving the idea that deep learning has subsumed artificial neural networks. The quintessential example of a deep learning model is the feedforward deep network or multilayer perceptron (MLP). Peter Norvig is the Director of Research at Google and famous for his textbook on AI titled “ Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach “. In a 2016 talk he gave titled “ Deep Learning and Understandability versus Software Engineering and Verification ” he defined deep learning in a very similar way to Yoshua, focusing on the power of abstraction permitted by using a deeper network structure. a kind of learning where the representation you form have several levels of abstraction, rather than a direct input to output Why Call it “ Deep Learning “? Why Not Just “ Artificial Neural Networks “? Geoffrey Hinton is a pioneer in the field of artificial neural networks and co-published the first paper on the backpropagation algorithm for training multilayer perceptron networks. He may have started the introduction of the phrasing “ deep ” to describe the development of large artificial neural networks. He co-authored a paper in 2006 titled “ A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets ” in which they describe an approach to training “deep” (as in a many layered network) of restricted Boltzmann machines. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. This paper and the related paper Geoff co-authored titled “ Deep Boltzmann Machines ” on an undirected deep network were well received by the community (now cited many hundreds of times) because they were successful examples of greedy layer-wise training of networks, allowing many more layers in feedforward networks. In a co-authored article in Science titled “ Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks ” they stuck with the same description of “deep” to describe their approach to developing networks with many more layers than was previously typical. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data. In the same article, they make an interesting comment that meshes with Andrew Ng’s comment about the recent increase in compute power and access to large datasets that has unleashed the untapped capability of neural networks when used at larger scale. It has been obvious since the 1980s that backpropagation through deep autoencoders would be very effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, provided that computers were fast enough, data sets were big enough, and the initial weights were close enough to a good solution. All three conditions are now satisfied. In a talk to the Royal Society in 2016 titled “ Deep Learning “, Geoff commented that Deep Belief Networks were the start of deep learning in 2006 and that the first successful application of this new wave of deep learning was to speech recognition in 2009 titled “ Acoustic Modeling using Deep Belief Networks “, achieving state of the art results. It was the results that made the speech recognition and the neural network communities take notice, the use “deep” as a differentiator on previous neural network techniques that probably resulted in the name change. The descriptions of deep learning in the Royal Society talk are very backpropagation centric as you would expect. Interesting, he gives 4 reasons why backpropagation (read “deep learning”) did not take off last time around in the 1990s. The first two points match comments by Andrew Ng above about datasets being too small and computers being too slow. What Was Actually Wrong With Backpropagation in 1986? Slide by Geoff Hinton , all rights reserved. Deep Learning as Scalable Learning Across Domains Deep learning excels on problem domains where the inputs (and even output) are analog. Meaning, they are not a few quantities in a tabular format but instead are images of pixel data, documents of text data or files of audio data . Yann LeCun is the director of Facebook Research and is the father of the network architecture that excels at object recognition in image data called the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) . This technique is seeing great success because like multilayer perceptron feedforward neural networks, the technique scales with data and model size and can be trained with backpropagation. This biases his definition of deep learning as the development of very large CNNs, which have had great success on object recognition in photographs. In a 2016 talk at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory titled “ Accelerating Understanding: Deep Learning, Intelligent Applications, and GPUs ” he described deep learning generally as learning hierarchical representations and defines it as a scalable approach to building object recognition systems: deep learning [is] … a pipeline of modules all of which are trainable. … deep because [has] multiple stages in the process of recognizing an object and all of those stages are part of the training” Deep Learning = Learning Hierarchical Representations Slide by Yann LeCun , all rights reserved. Jurgen Schmidhuber is the father of another popular algorithm that like MLPs and CNNs also scales with model size and dataset size and can be trained with backpropagation, but is instead tailored to learning sequence data, called the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) , a type of recurrent neural network. We do see some confusion in the phrasing of the field as “deep learning”. In his 2014 paper titled “ Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview ” he does comment on the problematic naming of the field and the differentiation of deep from shallow learning. He also interestingly describes depth in terms of the complexity of the problem rather than the model used to solve the problem. At which problem depth does Shallow Learning end, and Deep Learning begin? Discussions with DL experts have not yet yielded a conclusive response to this question. […], let me just define for the purposes of this overview: problems of depth > 10 require Very Deep Learning. Demis Hassabis is the founder of DeepMind , later acquired by Google. DeepMind made the breakthrough of combining deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning to handle complex learning problems like game playing, famously demonstrated in playing Atari games and the game Go with Alpha Go. In keeping with the naming, they called their new technique a Deep Q-Network, combining Deep Learning with Q-Learning. They also name the broader field of study “Deep Reinforcement Learning”. In their 2015 nature paper titled “ Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning ” they comment on the important role of deep neural networks in their breakthrough and highlight the need for hierarchical abstraction. To achieve this,we developed a novel agent, a deep Q-network (DQN), which is able to combine reinforcement learning with a class of artificial neural network known as deep neural networks. Notably, recent advances in deep neural networks, in which several layers of nodes are used to build up progressively more abstract representations of the data, have made it possible for artificial neural networks to learn concepts such as object categories directly from raw sensory data. Finally, in what may be considered a defining paper in the field, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton published a paper in Nature titled simply “ Deep Learning “. In it, they open with a clean definition of deep learning highlighting the multi-layered approach. Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Later the multi-layered approach is described in terms of representation learning and abstraction . Deep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. […] The key aspect of deep learning is that these layers of features are not designed by human engineers: they are learned from data using a general-purpose learning procedure. This is a nice and generic a description, and could easily describe most artificial neural network algorithms. It is also a good note to end on. Summary In this post you discovered that deep learning is just very big neural networks on a lot more data, requiring bigger computers. Although early approaches published by Hinton and collaborators focus on greedy layerwise training and unsupervised methods like autoencoders, modern state-of-the-art deep learning is focused on training deep (many layered) neural network models using the backpropagation algorithm. The most popular techniques are: Multilayer Perceptron Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks. Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks.

The reason that CNN would be better is that CNN work as an automatic feature extractor and you won’t need to bother yourself of feature selection and wondering if the extracted feature would weather work with the model or not. CNN extracts all possible features, from low-level features like edges to higher-level features like faces and objects.

The input can be represent as character but how can someone encode this as input in neural network, so it can learn and output the target at the same time. Please help. Regards Abbey Reply Jason Brownlee November 14, 2016 at 7:46 am # Very cool problem Abbey. I would suggest starting off by collecting a very high-quality dataset of messages and expected translation. I would then suggest encoding the words as integers and use a word embedding to project the integer vectors into a higher dimensional space. Let me know how you go. Reply Sam Wilson January 5, 2017 at 4:14 am # Hi, thanks for the good overview. In your opinion, on what field CNN could be used in developing countries? Because there seems less raw data than developed countries, i couldn’t think of any use of CNN in developing countries. Reply Jason Brownlee January 5, 2017 at 9:41 am # Sorry Sam, I don’t know. CNNs are state of the art on many problems that have spatial structure (or structure that can be made spatial). Anything with images is a great start, domains like text and time series are also interesting. Reply Danie Truter March 21, 2017 at 1:10 am # Hi… I am an average developer in a developing country and my opinion is “yes”… if you find a way to get all these “disconnected” data together than you can help on gathering these data to make it easier for developing countries not to make the same mistakes as developed countries… thus bringing the cost down on “becoming” a developed country without the cost… the “research” exist… the implementation is the problem… Reply Muhammad Faisal February 26, 2017 at 12:42 am # Hello Jason, a very well and nicely explained article for the beginners.

One striking feature of your blogs is simplicity which draws me regularly to this place! This is very helpful.:) Talking about Deep Learning vs traditional ML, the general conception is that Deep Learning beats a human being at its ability to do feature abstraction. Is this true? Also, could you tell me why Deep Learning fails to achieve more than many of the traditional ML algorithms for different datasets despite the assumed superiority of DL in feature abstraction over other algorithms? Reply Jason Brownlee June 27, 2017 at 8:27 am # Deep learning is great at feature extraction and in turn state of the art prediction on what I call “analog data”, e.g. images, text, audio, etc. It can be used on tabular data (e.g. spreadsheet of numbers) but this is not it’s sweet spot and often can be beaten by other methods, like gradient boosting. There is no one algorithm to rule them all, just different algorithms for different problems and our job is to discover what works best on a given problem.

Therefore, it is a type of deep neural network. Yes, neural nets require all input data to be tabular (vectorized). I cannot know if your model is right. Evaluate it carefully and compare it to other models. Reply mera August 17, 2017 at 11:29 pm # if we use hierarchal training algorithm such as we use unsupervised learning autoencoder with bottleneck (hidden layer, 10,2,10) for training then use the supervised learning with same autoencoder architecture ( hidden layer, 10,2,10) to tune the unsupervised model parameter (weights, bias). These training processes are performed separately. now the unsupervised autoencoder works as dimension reduction and extract features. does the supervised model work in the same way and extract the feature or just this step conducted in the unsupervised learning Reply Jason Brownlee August 18, 2017 at 6:20 am # he supervised model will interpret the features and use them to make predictions.

How exactly is the model “bigger”? What’s an example of a “not big model” and why is that worse? And what exactly is meant by the term “model” in this field? I’m still not clear on that. Like what exactly are the characteristics that make something a “model” and why is another general programming algorithm like, say, a loop that divides numbers successively to determine if an integer is prime, not a “model”? To me that sounds like a “model” for determining if a number is prime, so what is meant in this field by “model”? What are the inherent properties that make something a “model”? Is a model a type of algorithm? Is it a class in object-oriented design? What’s a “model” and what;s a “bigger model”?

Reply Jason Brownlee November 1, 2017 at 5:43 am # A model is often referred to as the weights + structure after the training algorithm has been run on data. It is the “program” that can make predictions on new data. Reply naivebae November 1, 2017 at 7:55 am # And then what’s the “bigger model” you refer to in this article? Are there more weights and more structure in the training algorithm? How is that achieved? Do you plug in more equations and more variables and decision parameters/whatever? How do you know what additional equations and parameters to plug in, and how do you know those are the right ones as opposed to others? Or does “bigger models” simply refer to running on more overall data, and the training algorithm is the same with the same amount of equations/variables/computations per training example? Jason Brownlee November 1, 2017 at 4:13 pm # “Larger Models” refers to deeper (more layers) or wider (more neurons per layer), ultimately more representational capacity.

In the article it is said that Deep Learning’s performance get better with more data while other, older algorithms tends to reach a plateau. Can you explain more and give an example about the plateau? Initially I think the plateau is there because more data can cause overfitting, but after some browsing I found out that more data will decrease the chance of overfitting. It is the number of feature, not the number of data that causes overfitting. The only thing I can think about how more data can create plateau is on heuristic algorithm, which can create more local minima where algorithms can get stuck on.

What I understood is that the hidden layers act as feature learners from the data. They achieve this by successively applying nonlinear transformations (with the activation functions) on the input data to map them into a new space: the feature space. In case of a classification task, the classes become easier (linearly) to separatein this feature space. What about in the case of regression? What is the function of the hidden layers in a deep neural network model for regression. Thank you in advance! Reply Izzy February 24, 2019 at 10:15 am # I would say: In case of regression, there is the nonlinear transformation of the input data to the feature space and there a linear regression in that new feature space can be applied to aproximate the numerical target variable. Reply Jason Brownlee February 25, 2019 at 6:34 am # Not quite, the model can learn a non-linear separation of classes. Same idea, but it learns a non-linear fit for association between the inputs to the output value. Reply Izzy February 25, 2019 at 11:11 pm # ok, thank you for the response. Is what I said the case for SVR? Reply Jason Brownlee February 26, 2019 at 6:22 am # Not quite, an SVM can have a non-linear kernel. Reply Izzy March 6, 2019 at 5:04 am # yes sure. It is the non linear kernel that enables the non linear transformation of the input data to the feature space. Isn’t the same principle as the activation functions in the hidden layers of a deep neural network? Reply Jason Brownlee March 6, 2019 at 7:59 am # Yes, similar.

Being new to ML, this site is looking promising.Thank you. I was considering using Google AutoML ( https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs/ ) on structured and labelled (probabaly JSON) but very large sets of textual data, to encode some near-subjective decision making that could possibly be explicitly coded, but with quite some complexity. It could just be more elegant and scalable if a machine model could be trained, with human guidance. If that sounds at all feasible, should I start with machine-learning-in-r-step-by-step and at least get used to the field using the “shallow” ML algorithms mentioned there, or would deep-learning likely prove more beneficial but still be an intelligible subject to a newcomer? Eventually I’d want to employ this in an app. Reply Jason Brownlee July 27, 2019 at 6:10 am # I think it is a good idea to get familiar with the basics of working through small problems end to end first.

Reply Jason Brownlee October 20, 2019 at 6:14 am # Setting the right parameters gives everyone trouble.

From classifying images and translating languages to building a self-driving car, all these tasks are being driven by computers rather than manual human effort. Deep learning has penetrated into multiple and diverse industries, and it continues to break new ground on an almost weekly basis. Understandably, a ton of folks are suddenly interested in getting into this field. But where should you start? What should you learn? What are the core concepts that actually make up this complex yet intriguing field? I’m excited to pen down a series of articles where I will break down the basic components that every deep learning enthusiast should know thoroughly. My inspiration comes from deeplearning.ai, who released an awesome deep learning specialization course which I have found immensely helpful in my learning journey. In this article, I will be writing about Course 1 of the specialization, where the great Andrew Ng explains the basics of Neural Networks and how to implement them. Let’s get started! Note: We will follow a bottom-up approach throughout this series – we will first understand the concept from the ground-up, and only then follow it’s implementation. This approach has proven to be very helpful for me.

Then read on! 2. Course 1 : Neural Networks and Deep Learning Alright, now that we have a sense of the structure of this article, it’s time to start from scratch. Put on your learning hats because this is going to be a fun experience. 2.1 Module 1: Introduction to Deep Learning The objectives behind this first module are below: Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning Be able to explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning Understand what are the major categories of models (such as CNNs and RNNs), and when they should be applied Be able to recognize the basics of when deep learning will (or will not) work well What is a Neural Network? Let’s begin with the crux of the matter and a very critical question. What is a neural network? Consider an example where we have to predict the price of a house. The variables we are given are the size of the house in square feet (or square meters) and the price of the house. Now assume we have 6 houses. So first let’s pull up a plot to visualize what we’re looking at: On the x-axis, we have the size of the house and on the y-axis we have it’s corresponding price. A linear regression model will try to draw a straight line to fit the data: So, the input(x) here is the size of the house and output(y) is the price. Now let’s look at how we can solve this using a simple neural network: Here, a neuron will take an input, apply some activation function to it, and generate an output. One of the most commonly used activation function is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): ReLU takes a real number as input and returns the maximum of 0 or that number. So, if we pass 10, the output will be 10, and if the input is -10, the output will be 0. We will discuss activation functions in detail later in this article. For now let’s stick to our example. If we use the ReLU activation function to predict the price of a house based on its size, this is how the predictions may look: So far, we have seen a neural network with a single neuron, i.e., we only had one feature (size of the house) to predict the house price. But in reality, we’ll have to consider multiple features like number of bedrooms, postal code, etc.? House price can also depend on the family size, neighbourhood location or school quality. How can we define a neural network in such cases? It gets a bit complicated here. Refer to the above image as you read – we pass 4 features as input to the neural network as x, it automatically identifies some hidden features from the input, and finally generates the output y. This is how a neural network with 4 inputs and an output with single hidden layer will look like: Now that we have an intuition of what neural networks are, let’s see how we can use them for supervised learning problems. Supervised Learning with Neural Networks Supervised learning refers to a task where we need to find a function that can map input to corresponding outputs (given a set of input-output pairs). We have a defined output for each given input and we train the model on these examples. Below is a pretty handy table that looks at the different applications of supervised learning and the different types of neural networks that can be used to solve those problems: Input (X) Output (y) Application Type of Neural Network Home Features Price Real Estate Standard Neural Network Ad, user info Click prediction (0/1) Online Advertising Standard Neural Network Image Image Class Photo Tagging CNN Audio Text Transcript Speech Recognition RNN English Chinese Machine Translation RNN Image, Radar info Position of car Autonomous Driving Custom / Hybrid NN Below is a visual representation of the most common Neural Network types: In this article, we will be focusing on the standard neural networks. Don’t worry, we will cover the other types in upcoming articles. As you might be aware, supervised learning can be used on both structured and unstructured data. In our house price prediction example, the given data tells us the size and the number of bedrooms. This is structured data, meaning that each feature, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, etc. has a very well defined meaning. In contrast, unstructured data refers to things like audio, raw audio, or images where you might want to recognize what’s in the image or text (like object detection). Here, the features might be the pixel values in an image, or the individual words in a piece of text. It’s not really clear what each pixel of the image represents and therefore this falls under the unstructured data umbrella. Simple machine learning algorithms work well with structured data. But when it comes to unstructured data, their performance tends to take quite a dip. This is where neural networks have proven to be so effective and useful. They perform exceptionally well on unstructured data. Most of the ground-breaking research these days has neural networks at it’s core. Why is Deep Learning Taking off? To understand this, take a look at the below graph: As the amount of data increases, the performance of traditional learning algorithms, like SVM and logistic regression, does not improve by a whole lot. In fact, it tends to plateau after a certain point. In the case of neural networks, the performance of the model increases with an increase in the data you feed to the model. There are basically three scales that drive a typical deep learning process: Data Computation Time Algorithms To improve the computation time of the model, activation function plays an important role. If we use a sigmoid activation function, this is what we end up with: The slope, or the gradient of this function, at the extreme ends is close to zero. Therefore, the parameters are updated very slowly, resulting in very slow learning. Hence, switching from a sigmoid activation function to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is one of the biggest breakthroughs we have seen in neural networks. ReLU updates the parameters much faster as the slope is 1 when x>0. This is the primary reason for faster computation of the models. 2.2 Module 2: Introduction to Deep Learning The objectives behind module 2 are to: Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset Become familiar with Python and Numpy This module is further divided into two parts: Part I: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network Part II: Python and Vectorization Let’s walk through each part in detail. Part I: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network Binary Classification In a binary classification problem, we have an input x, say an image, and we have to classify it as having a cat or not. If it is a cat, we will assign it a 1, else 0. So here, we have only two outputs – either the image contains a cat or it does not. This is an example of a binary classification problem. We can of course use the most popular classification technique, logistic regression, in this case. Logistic Regression We have an input X (image) and we want to know the probability that the image belongs to class 1 (i.e. a cat). For a given X vector, the output will be: y = w(transpose)X + b Here w and b are the parameters. Since our output y is probability, it should range between 0 and 1. But in the above equation, it can take any real value, which doesn’t make sense for getting the probability. So logistic regression also uses a sigmoid function to output probabilities: For any value as input, it will only return values in the 0 to 1 range. The formula for a sigmoid function is: So, if z is very large, exp(-z) will be close to 0, and therefore the output of the sigmoid will be 1. Similarly, if z is very small, exp(-z) will be infinity and hence the output of the sigmoid will be 0. Note that the parameter w is nx dimensional vector, and b is a real number. Now let’s look at the cost function for logistic regression. Logistic Regression Cost Function To train the parameters w and b of logistic regression, we need a cost function. We want to find parameters w and b such that at least on the training set, the outputs you have (y-hat) are close to the actual values (y). We can use a loss function defined below: The problem with this function is that the optimization problem becomes non-convex, resulting in multiple local optima. Hence, gradient descent will not work well with this loss function. So, for logistic regression, we define a different loss function that plays a similar role as that of the above loss function and also solves the optimization problem by giving a convex function: Loss function is defined for a single training example which tells us how well we are doing on that particular example. On the other hand, a cost function is for the entire training set. Cost function for logistic regression is: We want our cost function to be as small as possible . For that, we want our parameters w and b to be optimized. Gradient Descent This is a technique that helps to learn the parameters w and b in such a way that the cost function is minimized. The cost function for logistic regression is convex in nature (i.e. only one global minima) and that is the reason for choosing this function instead of the squared error (can have multiple local minima). Let’s look at the steps for gradient descent: Initialize w and b (usually initialized to 0 for logistic regression) Take a step in the steepest downhill direction Repeat step 2 until global optimum is achieved The updated equation for gradient descent becomes: Here, ⍺ is the learning rate that controls how big a step we should take after each iteration. If we are on the right side of the graph shown above, the slope will be positive. Using the updated equation, we will move to the left (i.e. downward direction) until the global minima is reached. Whereas if we are on the left side, the slope will be negative and hence we will take a step towards the right (downward direction) until the global minima is reached. Pretty intuitive, right? The updated equations for the parameters of logistic regression are: Derivatives Consider a function, f(a) = 3a, as shown below: The derivative of this function at any point will give the slope at that point. So, f(a=2) = 3*2 = 6 f(a=2.001) = 3*2.001 = 6.003 Slope/derivative of the function at a = 2 is: Slope = height/width Slope = 0.003 / 0.001 = 3 This is how we calculate the derivative/slope of a function. Let’s look at a few more examples of derivatives. More Derivative Examples Consider the 3 functions below and their corresponding derivatives: f(a) = a2 , d(f(a))/d(a) = 2a f(a) = a3, d(f(a))/d(a) = 3a2 Finally, f(a) = log(a), d(f(a))/d(a) = 1/a In all the above examples, the derivative is a function of a, which means that the slope of a function is different at different points. Computation Graph These graphs organize the computation of a specific function. Consider the below example: J(a,b,c) = 3(a+bc) We have to calculate J given a, b, and c. We can divide this into three steps: u = bc v = a+u J = 3v Let’s visualize these steps for a = 5, b = 3 and c = 2: This is the forward propagation step where we have calculated the output, i.e., J. We can also use computation graphs for backward propagation where we update the parameters, a,b and c in the above example. Derivatives with a Computation Graph Now let’s see how we can calculate derivatives with the help of a computation graph. Suppose we have to calculate dJ/da. The steps will be: Since J is a function of v, calculate dJ/dv: dJ/dv = d(3v)/dv = 3 Since v is a function of a and u, calculate dv/da: dv/da = d(a+u)/da = 1 Calculate dJ/da: dJ/da =  (dJ/dv)*(dv/da) = 3*1 = 3 Similarly, we can calculate dJ/db and dJ/dc: Now we will take the concept of computation graphs and gradient descent together and see how the parameters of logistic regression can be updated. Logistic Regression Gradient Descent Just to quickly recap, the equations of logistic regression are: where L is the loss function. Now, for two features (x1 and x2), the computation graph for calculating the loss will be: Here, w1, w2, and b are the parameters that need to be updated. Below are the steps to do this (for w1): Calculate da: da = dL/da = (-y/a) + (1-y)/(1-a) Calculate dz: dz =  (dL/da)*(da/dz) =  [(-y/a) + (1-y)/(1-a)]*[a(1-a)] = a-y Calculate dw1: dw1 = [(dL/da)*(da/dz)]*dz/dw1 = (a-y)*dz/dw1 Similarly, we can calculate dw2 and db. Finally, the weights will be updated using the following equations: Keep in mind that this is for a single training example. We will have multiple examples in real-world scenarios. So, let’s look at how gradient descent can be calculated for ‘m’ training examples. Gradient Descent on ‘m’ Examples We can define the predictions and cost function for ‘m’ training examples as: The derivative of a loss function w.r.t the parameters can be written as: Let’s now see how we can apply logistic regression for ‘m’ examples: J = 0; dw1 = 0; dw2 =0; db = 0;                 w1 = 0; w2 = 0; b=0;                             for i = 1 to m     # Forward pass     z(i) = W1*x1(i) + W2*x2(i) + b     a(i) = Sigmoid(z(i))     J += (Y(i)*log(a(i)) + (1-Y(i))*log(1-a(i)))          # Backward pass     dz(i) = a(i) - Y(i)     dw1 += dz(i) * x1(i)     dw2 += dz(i) * x2(i)     db  += dz(i) J /= m dw1/= m dw2/= m db/= m  # Gradient descent w1 = w1 - alpa * dw1 w2 = w2 - alpa * dw2 b = b - alpa * db These for loops end up making the computation very slow. There is a way by which these loops can be replaced in order to make the code more efficient. We will look at these tricks in the coming sections. Part II – Python and Vectorization Up to this point, we have seen how to use gradient descent for updating the parameters for logistic regression. In the above example, we saw that if we have ‘m’ training examples, we have to run the loop ‘m’ number of times to get the output, which makes the computation very slow. Instead of these for loops, we can use vectorization which is an effective and time efficient approach. Vectorization Vectorization is basically a way of getting rid of for loops in our code. It performs all the operations together for ‘m’ training examples instead of computing them individually. Let’s look at non-vectorized and vectorized representation of logistic regression: Non-vectorized form: z = 0 for i in range(nx):    z += w[i] * x[i] z +=b Now, let’s look at the vectorized form. We can represent the w and x in a vector form: Now we can calculate Z for all the training examples using: Z = np.dot(W,X)+b   ( numpy is imported as np) The dot function of NumPy library uses vectorization by default. This is how we can vectorize the multiplications. Let’s now see how we can vectorize an entire logistic regression algorithm. Vectorizing Logistic Regression Keeping with the ‘m’ training examples, the first step will be to calculate Z for all of these examples: Z = np.dot(W.T, X) + b Here, X contains the features for all the training examples while W is the coefficient matrix for these examples. The next step is to calculate the output(A) which is the sigmoid of Z: A = 1 / 1 + np.exp(-Z) Now, calculate the loss and then use backpropagation to minimize the loss: dz = A – Y Finally, we will calculate the derivative of the parameters and update them: dw = np.dot(X, dz.T) / m db = dz .sum() / m W = W – ⍺dw b = b – ⍺db Broadcasting in Python Broadcasting makes certain parts of the code much more efficient. But don’t just take my word for it! Let’s look at some examples: obj.sum(axis = 0) sums the columns while obj.sum(axis = 1) sums the rows obj.reshape(1,4) changes the shape of the matrix by broadcasting the values If we add 100 to a (4×1) matrix, it will copy 100 to a (4×1) matrix. Similarly, in the example below, (1×3) matrix will be copied to form a (2×3) matrix: The general principle will be: If we add, subtract, multiply or divide an (m,n) matrix with a (1,n) matrix, this will copy it m times into an (m,n) matrix. This is called broadcasting and it makes the computations much faster. Try it out yourself! A note on Python/Numpy Vectors If you form an array using: a = np.random.randn(5) It will create an array of shape (5,) which is a rank 1 array. Using this array will cause problems while taking the transpose of the array. Instead, we can use the following code to form a vector instead of a rank 1 array: a = np.random.randn(5,1)    # shape (5,1) column vector a = np.random.randn(1,5)    # shape (1,5) row vector To convert a (1,5) row vector to a (5,1) column vector, one can use: a = a.reshape((5,1)) That’s it for module 2. In the next section, we will dive deeper into the details of a Shallow Neural Network. 2.3 Module 3: Shallow Neural Networks The objectives behind module 3 are to: Understand hidden units and hidden layers Be able to apply a variety of activation functions in a neural network. Build your first forward and backward propagation with a hidden layer Apply random initialization to your neural network Become fluent with Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations Build and train a neural network with one hidden layer Neural Networks Overview In logistic regression, to calculate the output (y = a), we used the below computation graph: In case of a neural network with a single hidden layer, the structure will look like: And the computation graph to calculate the output will be: X1  \  X2   => z1 = XW1 + B1 => a1 = Sigmoid(z1) => z2 = a1W2 + B2 => a2 = Sigmoid(z2) => l(a2,Y) X3  / Neural Network Representation Consider the following representation of a neural network: Can you identify the number of layers in the above neural network? Remember that while counting the number of layers in a NN, we do not count the input layer. So, there are 2 layers in the NN shown above, i.e., one hidden layer and one output layer. The first layer is referred as a [0] , second layer as a [1] , and the final layer as a [2] . Here ‘a’ stands for activations, which are the values that different layers of a neural network passes on to the next layer. The corresponding parameters are w [1] , b [1] and w [1] , b [2] : This is how a neural network is represented. Next we will look at how to compute the output from a neural network. Computing a Neural Network’s Output Let’s look in detail at how each neuron of a neural network works. Each neuron takes an input, performs some operation on them (calculates z = w [T] + b), and then applies the sigmoid function: This step is performed by each neuron. The equations for the first hidden layer with four neurons will be: So, for given input X, the outputs for each neuron will be: z [1] = W [1] x + b [1] a [1] = 𝛔(z [1] ) z [2] = W [2] x + b [2] a [2] = 𝛔(z [2] ) To compute these outputs, we need to run a for loop which will calculate these values individually for each neuron. But recall that using a for loop will make the computations very slow, and hence we should optimize the code to get rid of this for loop and run it faster. Vectorizing across multiple examples The non-vectorized form of computing the output from a neural network is: for i=1 to m:  z [1] (i) = W [1] (i) x + b [1] a [1] (i) = 𝛔(z [1] (i) )  z [2] (i) = W [2] (i) x + b [2] a [2] (i) = 𝛔(z [2] (i) ) Using this for loop, we are calculating z and a value for each training example separately. Now we will look at how it can be vectorized. All the training examples will be merged in a single matrix X: Here, nx is the number of features and m is the number of training examples. The vectorized form for calculating the output will be: Z [1] = W [1] X + b [1] A [1] = 𝛔(Z [1] ) Z [2] = W [2] X + b [2] A [2] = 𝛔(Z [2] ) This will reduce the computation time (significantly in most cases). Activation Function While calculating the output, an activation function is applied. The choice of an activation function highly affects the performance of the model. So far, we have used the sigmoid activation function: However, this might not the best option in some cases. Why? Because at the extreme ends of the graph, the derivative will be close to zero and hence the gradient descent will update the parameters very slowly. There are other functions which can replace this activation function: tanh: ReLU (already covered earlier): Activation Function Pros Cons Sigmoid Used in the output layer for binary classification Output ranges from 0 to 1 tanh Better than sigmoid Updates parameters slowly when points are at extreme ends ReLU Updates parameters faster as slope is 1 when x>0 Zero slope when x<0 We can choose different activation functions depending on the problem we’re trying to solve. Why do we need non-linear activation functions? If we use linear activation functions on the output of the layers, it will compute the output as a linear function of input features. We first calculate the Z value as: Z = WX + b In case of linear activation functions, the output will be equal to Z (instead of calculating any non-linear activation): A = Z Using linear activation is essentially pointless. The composition of two linear functions is itself a linear function, and unless we use some non-linear activations, we are not computing more interesting functions. That’s why most experts stick to using non-linear activation functions. There is only one scenario where we tend to use a linear activation function. Suppose we want to predict the price of a house (which can be any positive real number). If we use a sigmoid or tanh function, the output will range from (0,1) and (-1,1) respectively. But the price will be more than 1 as well. In this case, we will use a linear activation function at the output layer. Once we have the outputs, what’s the next step? We want to perform backpropagation in order to update the parameters using gradient descent. Gradient Descent for Neural Networks The parameters which we have to update in a two-layer neural network are: w[1], b[1], w[2] and b[2], and the cost function which we will be minimizing is: The gradient descent steps can be summarized as: Repeat: Compute predictions (y' (i) , i = 1,...m)     Get derivatives: dW [1] , db [1] , dW [2] , db [2] Update: W [1] = W [1] - ⍺ * dW [1] b [1] = b [1] - ⍺ * db [1] W [2] = W [2] - ⍺ * dW [2] b [2] = b [2] - ⍺ * db [2] Let’s quickly look at the forward and backpropagation steps for a two-layer neural networks. Forward propagation: Z [1] = W [1] *A [0] + b [1] # A [0] is X A [1] = g [1] (Z [1] ) Z [2] = W [2] *A [1] + b [2] A [2] = g [2] (Z [2] ) Backpropagation: dZ [2] = A [2] - Y    dW [2] = (dZ [2] * A [1] .T) / m db [2] = Sum(dZ [2] ) / m dZ [1] = (W [2] .T * dZ [2] ) * g' [1] (Z [1] )  # element wise product (*) dW [1] = (dZ [1] * A [0] .T) / m   # A [0] = X db [1] = Sum(dZ [1] ) / m These are the complete steps a neural network performs to generate outputs. Note that we have to initialize the weights (W) in the beginning which are then updated in the backpropagation step. So let’s look at how these weights should be initialized. Random Initialization We have previously seen that the weights are initialized to 0 in case of a logistic regression algorithm. But should we initialize the weights of a neural network to 0? It’s a pertinent question. Let’s consider the example shown below: If the weights are initialized to 0, the W matrix will be: Using these weights: And finally at the backpropagation step: No matter how many units we use in a layer, we are always getting the same output which is similar to that of using a single unit. So, instead of initializing the weights to 0, we randomly initialize them using the following code: w [1] = np.random.randn((2,2)) * 0.01 b [1] = np.zero((2,1)) We multiply the weights with 0.01 to initialize small weights. If we initialize large weights, the activation will be large, resulting in zero slope (in case of sigmoid and tanh activation function). Hence, learning will be slow. So we generally initialize small weights randomly. 2.4 Module 4: Deep Neural Networks It’s finally time to learn about deep neural networks! These have become today’s buzzword in the industry and the research field. No matter which research paper I pick up these days, there is inevitably a mention of how a deep neural network was used to power the thought process behind the study. The objectives of our final module are to: See deep neural networks as successive blocks put one after each other Build and train a deep L-layer Neural Network Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations Understand how to use a cache to pass information from forward propagation to backpropagation Understand the role of hyperparameters in deep learning Deep L-Layer Neural Network In this section, we will look at how the concepts of forward and backpropogation can be applied to deep neural networks. But you might be wondering at this point what in the world deep neural networks actually are? Shallow vs depth is a matter of degree. A logistic regression is a very shallow model as it has only one layer (remember we don’t count the input as a layer): A deeper neural network has more number of hidden layers: Let’s look at some of the notations related to deep neural networks: L is the number of layers in the neural network n [l] is the number of units in layer l a [l] is the activations in layer l w [l] is the weights for z[l] These are some of the notations which we will be using in the upcoming sections. Keep them in mind as we proceed, or just quickly hop back here in case you miss something. Forward Propagation in a Deep Neural Network For a single training example, the forward propagation steps can be written as: z [l] = W [l] a [l-1] + b [l] a [l] = g [l] (z [l] ) We can vectorize these steps for ‘m’ training examples as shown below: Z [l] = W [l] A [l-1] + B [l] A [l] = g [l] (Z [l] ) These outputs from one layer act as an input for the next layer. We can’t compute the forward propagation for all the layers of a neural network without a for loop, so its fine to have a for loop here. Before moving further, let’s look at the dimensions of various matrices that will help us understand these steps in a better way. Getting your matrix dimensions right Analyzing the dimensions of a matrix is one of the best debugging tools to check how correct our code is. We will discuss what should be the correct dimension for each matrix in this section. Consider the following example: Can you figure out the number of layers (L) in this neural network? You are correct if you guessed 5. There are 4 hidden layers and 1 output layer. The units in each layer are: n [0] = 2, n [1] = 3, n [2] = 5, n [3] = 4, n [4] = 2,  and n [5] = 1 The generalized form of dimensions of W, b and their derivatives is: W [l] = (n [l] , n [l-1] ) b [l] = (n [l] , 1) dW [l] = (n [l] , n [l-1] ) db [l] = (n [l] ,1) Dimension of Z [l] , A [l] , dZ [l] , dA [l] = (n [l] ,m) where ‘m’ is the number of training examples. These are some of the generalized matrix dimensions which will help you to run your code smoothly. We have seen some of the basics of deep neural networks up to this point. But why do we need deep representations in the first place? Why make things complex when easier solutions exist? Let’s find out! Why Deep Representations? In deep neural networks, we have a large number of hidden layers. What are these hidden layers actually doing? To understand this, consider the below image: Deep neural networks find relations with the data (simpler to complex relations). What the first hidden layer might be doing, is trying to find simple functions like identifying the edges in the above image. And as we go deeper into the network, these simple functions combine together to form more complex functions like identifying the face. Some of the common examples of leveraging a deep neural network are: Face Recognition Image ==> Edges ==> Face parts ==> Faces ==> desired face Audio recognition Audio ==> Low level sound features like (sss, bb) ==> Phonemes ==> Words ==> Sentences Building Blocks of Deep Neural Networks Consider any layer in a deep neural network. The input to this layer will be the activations from the previous layer (l-1), and the output of this layer will be its own activations. Input: a [l-1] Output: a [l] This layer first calculates the z[l] on which the activations are applied. This z [l] is saved as cache. For the backward propagation step, it will first calculate da [l] , i.e., derivative of the activation at layer l, derivative of weights dw [l] , db [l] , dz [l] , and finally da [l-1] . Let’s visualize these steps to reduce the complexity: This is how each block (layer) of a deep neural network works. Next, we will see how to implement all of these blocks. Forward and Backward Propagation The input in a forward propagation step is a [l-1] and the outputs are a [l] and cache z [l] , which is a function of w [l] and b [l] . So, the vectorized form to calculate Z [l] and A [l] is: Z [l] = W [l] * A [l-1] + b [l] A [l] = g [l] (Z [l] ) We will calculate Z and A for each layer of the network. After calculating the activations, the next step is backward propagation, where we update the weights using the derivatives. The input for backward propagation is da [l] and the outputs are da [l-1] , dW [l] and db [l] . Let’s look at the vectorized equations for backward propagation: dZ [l] = dA [l] * g' [l] (Z [l] ) dW [l] = 1/m * (dZ [l] * A [l-1] .T) db [l] = 1/m * np.sum(dZ [l] , axis = 1, keepdims = True)  dA [l-1] = w [l] .T * dZ [l] This is how we implement deep neural networks. Deep Neural Networks perform surprisingly well (maybe not so surprising if you’ve used them before!). Running only a few lines of code gives us satisfactory results. This is because we are feeding a large amount of data to the network and it is learning from that data using the hidden layers. Choosing the right hyperparameters helps us to make our model more efficient. We will cover the details of hyperparameter tuning in the next article of this series. Parameters vs Hyperparameters This is an oft-asked question by deep learning newcomers. The major difference between parameters and hyperparameters is that parameters are learned by the model during the training time, while hyperparameters can be changed before training the model. Parameters of a deep neural network are W and b, which the model updates during the backpropagation step. On the other hand, there are a lot of hyperparameters for a deep NN, including: Learning rate – ⍺ Number of iterations Number of hidden layers Units in each hidden layer Choice of activation function This was a brief overview of the difference between these two aspects. I am happy to answer any questions you might have about this, in the comments section below. End Notes Congrats for completing the first course in this specialization! We now know how to implement forward and backward propagation and gradient descent for deep neural networks. We have also seen how vectorization helps us to get rid of explicit for loops, making our code efficient in the process. In the next article (which will cover course #2), we will see how we can improve deep neural networks by hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization. It’s one of the more tricky and fascinating aspects of deep learning. If you have any feedback or have any doubts/questions, please feel free to share them in the comments section below.

Feel free to check them out: Course 2 Course 4 Course 5 Reply Dat says: March 31, 2019 at 5:34 pm Thanks PULKIT SHARMA for these notes. I find them very clear and useful. However, I have been asking myself many times that, how activation functions like Relu, Leaky Relu, Tanh, etc., when being put into the deep neural network, can give such an accurate output to predict human behavior? What is the relationship between activation functions and human behavior? Is that the law of the universe, law of god, or something magic that cannot be explained clearly now? Furthermore, the explanation about Deep Representation, however, does not give me a clear intuition, how pixels being put into activation functions in many layers, then finally can show it is a cat or a dog? I look forward to your answers to my 2 questions, or any readings to clarify my doubts. Thank you very much! Wish you good health and success. Reply Karan says: April 01, 2019 at 3:58 am Hi Pulkit, Great tutorial! But I have a doubt. I might be missing something so please guide: L(a,y) = - (ylog(a) + (1-y)log(1-a)), then Calculate da: da = dL/da = (-y/a) + (1-y)/(1-a) Calculate dz: dz = (dL/da)*(da/dz) = [(-y/a) + (1-y)/(1-a)]*[a(1-a)] = a-y My doubt is, since the -ve sign in loss function is outside of the braces, wouldn't the value of ""da"" be -(y/a) -(1-y)/(1-a) ? Sorry, if that is a stupid question but kindly guide Thanks Reply Pulkit Sharma says: April 01, 2019 at 11:18 am Hi Dat, Glad you liked this post. Activation functions are one of the most important element of any neural network, whether it be ANNs or CNNs. They eventually decides whether a neuron should activate or not. I would recommend you to go through this article which will give you a better understanding of why activation functions are important and how can they help you to build a model equivalent to human behavior. Reply Pulkit Sharma says: April 01, 2019 at 11:29 am Hi Karan, The derivative of log(1-a) will be [1/(1-a)]*(-1) and hence the final value will be -(y/a) -[(1-y)/(1-a)]*(-1) = -(y/a) + (1-y)/(1-a) Reply Dat says: April 01, 2019 at 8:35 pm Thanks Pulkit Sharma for your reply. Actually, I have read your recommended article before and went through it one more time after your suggestion. And I understand that functions are called activation (like you said) because they eventually activate or do not activate that neuron. I also find the following paragraph partly answers my question: ""When our brain is fed with a lot of information simultaneously, it tries hard to understand and classify the information between useful and not-so-useful information. We need a similar mechanism to classify incoming information as useful or less-useful in case of Neural Networks. This is a very important in the way a network learns because not all information is equally useful. Some of it is just noise. Well, [activation functions help the network do this segregation. They help the network use the useful information and suppress the irrelevant data points]."" I still feel that the article is not sufficient for my curiosity. And I am also surprised that not so many people talk about this clearly. Please explain to me how those Relu functions when putting together in those hidden layers, can predict the very complicated nature of human behavior? Thank you very much for your patience.

3,A Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks — the ELI5 way | by Sumit Saha | Towards Data Science,"Open in app Home Notifications Lists Stories Write Published in Towards Data Science Sumit Saha Follow Dec 15, 2018 · 7 min read Save A Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks — the ELI5 way Artificial Intelligence has been witnessing a monumental growth in bridging the gap between the capabilities of humans and machines. Researchers and enthusiasts alike, work on numerous aspects of the field to make amazing things happen. One of many such areas is the domain of Computer Vision. The agenda for this field is to enable machines to view the world as humans do, perceive it in a similar manner and even use the knowledge for a multitude of tasks such as Image & Video recognition, Image Analysis & Classification, Media Recreation, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Processing, etc. The advancements in Computer Vision with Deep Learning has been constructed and perfected with time, primarily over one particular algorithm — a Convolutional Neural Network . Introduction A CNN sequence to classify handwritten digits A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics. The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area. Why ConvNets over Feed-Forward Neural Nets? Flattening of a 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector An image is nothing but a matrix of pixel values, right? So why not just flatten the image (e.g. 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector) and feed it to a Multi-Level Perceptron for classification purposes? Uh.. not really. In cases of extremely basic binary images, the method might show an average precision score while performing prediction of classes but would have little to no accuracy when it comes to complex images having pixel dependencies throughout. A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters involved and reusability of weights. In other words, the network can be trained to understand the sophistication of the image better. Input Image 4x4x3 RGB Image In the figure, we have an RGB image which has been separated by its three color planes — Red, Green, and Blue. There are a number of such color spaces in which images exist — Grayscale, RGB, HSV, CMYK, etc. You can imagine how computationally intensive things would get once the images reach dimensions, say 8K (7680×4320). The role of the ConvNet is to reduce the images into a form which is easier to process, without losing features which are critical for getting a good prediction. This is important when we are to design an architecture which is not only good at learning features but also is scalable to massive datasets. Convolution Layer — The Kernel Convoluting a 5x5x1 image with a 3x3x1 kernel to get a 3x3x1 convolved feature Image Dimensions = 5 (Height) x 5 (Breadth) x 1 (Number of channels, eg. RGB) In the above demonstration, the green section resembles our 5x5x1 input image, I . The element involved in carrying out the convolution operation in the first part of a Convolutional Layer is called the Kernel/Filter, K , represented in the color yellow. We have selected K as a 3x3x1 matrix. Kernel/Filter, K = 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 The Kernel shifts 9 times because of Stride Length = 1 (Non-Strided) , every time performing a matrix multiplication operation between K and the portion P of the image over which the kernel is hovering. Movement of the Kernel The filter moves to the right with a certain Stride Value till it parses the complete width. Moving on, it hops down to the beginning (left) of the image with the same Stride Value and repeats the process until the entire image is traversed. Convolution operation on a MxNx3 image matrix with a 3x3x3 Kernel In the case of images with multiple channels (e.g. RGB), the Kernel has the same depth as that of the input image. Matrix Multiplication is performed between Kn and In stack ([K1, I1]; [K2, I2]; [K3, I3]) and all the results are summed with the bias to give us a squashed one-depth channel Convoluted Feature Output. Convolution Operation with Stride Length = 2 The objective of the Convolution Operation is to extract the high-level features such as edges, from the input image. ConvNets need not be limited to only one Convolutional Layer. Conventionally, the first ConvLayer is responsible for capturing the Low-Level features such as edges, color, gradient orientation, etc. With added layers, the architecture adapts to the High-Level features as well, giving us a network which has the wholesome understanding of images in the dataset, similar to how we would. There are two types of results to the operation — one in which the convolved feature is reduced in dimensionality as compared to the input, and the other in which the dimensionality is either increased or remains the same. This is done by applying Valid Padding in case of the former, or Same Padding in the case of the latter. SAME padding: 5x5x1 image is padded with 0s to create a 6x6x1 image When we augment the 5x5x1 image into a 6x6x1 image and then apply the 3x3x1 kernel over it, we find that the convolved matrix turns out to be of dimensions 5x5x1. Hence the name — Same Padding . On the other hand, if we perform the same operation without padding, we are presented with a matrix which has dimensions of the Kernel (3x3x1) itself — Valid Padding . The following repository houses many such GIFs which would help you get a better understanding of how Padding and Stride Length work together to achieve results relevant to our needs. vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic A technical report on convolution arithmetic in the context of deep learning - vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic github.com Pooling Layer 3x3 pooling over 5x5 convolved feature Similar to the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it is useful for extracting dominant features which are rotational and positional invariant, thus maintaining the process of effectively training of the model. There are two types of Pooling: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Max Pooling returns the maximum value from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. On the other hand, Average Pooling returns the average of all the values from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. Max Pooling also performs as a Noise Suppressant . It discards the noisy activations altogether and also performs de-noising along with dimensionality reduction. On the other hand, Average Pooling simply performs dimensionality reduction as a noise suppressing mechanism. Hence, we can say that Max Pooling performs a lot better than Average Pooling . Types of Pooling The Convolutional Layer and the Pooling Layer, together form the i-th layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Depending on the complexities in the images, the number of such layers may be increased for capturing low-levels details even further, but at the cost of more computational power. After going through the above process, we have successfully enabled the model to understand the features. Moving on, we are going to flatten the final output and feed it to a regular Neural Network for classification purposes. Classification — Fully Connected Layer (FC Layer) Adding a Fully-Connected layer is a (usually) cheap way of learning non-linear combinations of the high-level features as represented by the output of the convolutional layer. The Fully-Connected layer is learning a possibly non-linear function in that space. Now that we have converted our input image into a suitable form for our Multi-Level Perceptron, we shall flatten the image into a column vector. The flattened output is fed to a feed-forward neural network and backpropagation applied to every iteration of training. Over a series of epochs, the model is able to distinguish between dominating and certain low-level features in images and classify them using the Softmax Classification technique. There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms which power and shall power AI as a whole in the foreseeable future.

3,What are Convolutional Neural Networks?  | IBM,"Skip to content IBM Cloud Learn Hub What are Convolutional Neural Networks? Convolutional Neural Networks By: IBM Cloud Education 20 October 2020 What are convolutional neural networks? How do convolutional neural networks work? Types of convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks and IBM Jump to ... What are convolutional neural networks? How do convolutional neural networks work? Types of convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks and IBM Convolutional Neural Networks Learn how convolutional neural networks use three-dimensional data to for image classification and object recognition tasks. What are convolutional neural networks? To reiterate from the Neural Networks Learn Hub article, neural networks are a subset of machine learning, and they are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network. While we primarily focused on feedforward networks in that article, there are various types of neural nets, which are used for different use cases and data types. For example, recurrent neural networks are commonly used for natural language processing and speech recognition whereas convolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are more often utilized for classification and computer vision tasks. Prior to CNNs, manual, time-consuming feature extraction methods were used to identify objects in images. However, convolutional neural networks now provide a more scalable approach to image classification and object recognition tasks, leveraging principles from linear algebra, specifically matrix multiplication, to identify patterns within an image. That said, they can be computationally demanding, requiring graphical processing units (GPUs) to train models. How do convolutional neural networks work? Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are: Convolutional layer Pooling layer Fully-connected (FC) layer The convolutional layer is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or pooling layers, the fully-connected layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object. Convolutional Layer The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are input data, a filter, and a feature map. Let’s assume that the input will be a color image, which is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D. This means that the input will have three dimensions—a height, width, and depth—which correspond to RGB in an image. We also have a feature detector, also known as a kernel or a filter, which will move across the receptive fields of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a convolution. The feature detector is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. While they can vary in size, the filter size is typically a 3x3 matrix; this also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the filter. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the filter shifts by a stride, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image. The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map, or a convolved feature. As you can see in the image above, each output value in the feature map does not have to connect to each pixel value in the input image. It only needs to connect to the receptive field, where the filter is being applied. Since the output array does not need to map directly to each input value, convolutional (and pooling) layers are commonly referred to as “partially connected” layers. However, this characteristic can also be described as local connectivity. Note that the weights in the feature detector remain fixed as it moves across the image, which is also known as parameter sharing. Some parameters, like the weight values, adjust during training through the process of backpropagation and gradient descent. However, there are three hyperparameters which affect the volume size of the output that need to be set before the training of the neural network begins. These include: 1. The number of filters affects the depth of the output. For example, three distinct filters would yield three different feature maps, creating a depth of three. 2. Stride is the distance, or number of pixels, that the kernel moves over the input matrix. While stride values of two or greater is rare, a larger stride yields a smaller output. 3. Zero-padding is usually used when the filters do not fit the input image. This sets all elements that fall outside of the input matrix to zero, producing a larger or equally sized output. There are three types of padding: Valid padding: This is also known as no padding. In this case, the last convolution is dropped if dimensions do not align. Same padding: This padding ensures that the output layer has the same size as the input layer Full padding: This type of padding increases the size of the output by adding zeros to the border of the input. After each convolution operation, a CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model. As we mentioned earlier, another convolution layer can follow the initial convolution layer. When this happens, the structure of the CNN can become hierarchical as the later layers can see the pixels within the receptive fields of prior layers.  As an example, let’s assume that we’re trying to determine if an image contains a bicycle. You can think of the bicycle as a sum of parts. It is comprised of a frame, handlebars, wheels, pedals, et cetera. Each individual part of the bicycle makes up a lower-level pattern in the neural net, and the combination of its parts represents a higher-level pattern, creating a feature hierarchy within the CNN. Ultimately, the convolutional layer converts the image into numerical values, allowing the neural network to interpret and extract relevant patterns. Pooling Layer Pooling layers, also known as downsampling, conducts dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of parameters in the input. Similar to the convolutional layer, the pooling operation sweeps a filter across the entire input, but the difference is that this filter does not have any weights. Instead, the kernel applies an aggregation function to the values within the receptive field, populating the output array. There are two main types of pooling: Max pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it selects the pixel with the maximum value to send to the output array. As an aside, this approach tends to be used more often compared to average pooling. Average pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it calculates the average value within the receptive field to send to the output array. While a lot of information is lost in the pooling layer, it also has a number of benefits to the CNN. They help to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and limit risk of overfitting. Fully-Connected Layer The name of the full-connected layer aptly describes itself. As mentioned earlier, the pixel values of the input image are not directly connected to the output layer in partially connected layers. However, in the fully-connected layer, each node in the output layer connects directly to a node in the previous layer. This layer performs the task of classification based on the features extracted through the previous layers and their different filters. While convolutional and pooling layers tend to use ReLu functions, FC layers usually leverage a softmax activation function to classify inputs appropriately, producing a probability from 0 to 1. Types of convolutional neural networks Kunihiko Fukushima and Yann LeCun laid the foundation of research around convolutional neural networks in their work in 1980 (PDF, 1.1 MB) (link resides outside IBM) and 1989 (PDF, 5.5 MB)(link resides outside of IBM), respectively. More famously, Yann LeCun successfully applied backpropagation to train neural networks to identify and recognize patterns within a series of handwritten zip codes. He would continue his research with his team throughout the 1990s, culminating with “LeNet-5”, (PDF, 933 KB) (link resides outside IBM), which applied the same principles of prior research to document recognition. Since then, a number of variant CNN architectures have emerged with the introduction of new datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, and competitions, like ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Some of these other architectures include: AlexNet (PDF, 1.4 MB) (link resides outside IBM) VGGNet (PDF, 195 KB) (link resides outside IBM) GoogLeNet (PDF, 1.3 MB) (link resides outside IBM) ResNet (PDF, 800 KB) (link resides outside IBM) ZFNet However, LeNet-5 is known as the classic CNN architecture. Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks power image recognition and computer vision tasks. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs, and based on those inputs, it can take action. This ability to provide recommendations distinguishes it from image recognition tasks. Some common applications of this computer vision today can be seen in: Marketing: Social media platforms provide suggestions on who might be in photograph that has been posted on a profile, making it easier to tag friends in photo albums. Healthcare: Computer vision has been incorporated into radiology technology, enabling doctors to better identify cancerous tumors in healthy anatomy. Retail: Visual search has been incorporated into some e-commerce platforms, allowing brands to recommend items that would complement an existing wardrobe. Automotive : While the age of driverless cars hasn’t quite emerged, the underlying technology has started to make its way into automobiles, improving driver and passenger safety through features like lane line detection. Convolutional neural networks and IBM For decades now, IBM has been a pioneer in the development of AI technologies and neural networks, highlighted by the development and evolution of IBM Watson. Watson is now a trusted solution for enterprises looking to apply advanced visual recognition and deep learning techniques to their systems using a proven tiered approach to AI adoption and implementation.

This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning. It can be hard to get your hands around what LSTMs are, and how terms like bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence relate to the field. In this post, you will get insight into LSTMs using the words of research scientists that developed the methods and applied them to new and important problems. There are few that are better at clearly and precisely articulating both the promise of LSTMs and how they work than the experts that developed them. We will explore key questions in the field of LSTMs using quotes from the experts, and if you’re interested, you will be able to dive into the original papers from which the quotes were taken. Kick-start your project with my new book Long Short-Term Memory Networks With Python , including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Long Short-Term Memory Networks by the Experts Oran Viriyincy The Promise of Recurrent Neural Networks Recurrent neural networks are different from traditional feed-forward neural networks. This difference in the addition of complexity comes with the promise of new behaviors that the traditional methods cannot achieve. Recurrent networks … have an internal state that can represent context information. … [they] keep information about past inputs for an amount of time that is not fixed a priori, but rather depends on its weights and on the input data. … A recurrent network whose inputs are not fixed but rather constitute an input sequence can be used to transform an input sequence into an output sequence while taking into account contextual information in a flexible way. — Yoshua Bengio, et al., Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent is Difficult , 1994. The paper defines 3 basic requirements of a recurrent neural network: That the system be able to store information for an arbitrary duration. That the system be resistant to noise (i.e. fluctuations of the inputs that are random or irrelevant to predicting a correct output). That the system parameters be trainable (in reasonable time). The paper also describes the “minimal task” for demonstrating recurrent neural networks. Context is key. Recurrent neural networks must use context when making predictions, but to this extent, the context required must also be learned. … recurrent neural networks contain cycles that feed the network activations from a previous time step as inputs to the network to influence predictions at the current time step. These activations are stored in the internal states of the network which can in principle hold long-term temporal contextual information. This mechanism allows RNNs to exploit a dynamically changing contextual window over the input sequence history — Hassim Sak, et al., Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Large Scale Acoustic Modeling , 2014 Need help with LSTMs for Sequence Prediction?

LSTMs Deliver on the Promise The success of LSTMs is in their claim to be one of the first implements to overcome the technical problems and deliver on the promise of recurrent neural networks. Hence standard RNNs fail to learn in the presence of time lags greater than 5 – 10 discrete time steps between relevant input events and target signals. The vanishing error problem casts doubt on whether standard RNNs can indeed exhibit significant practical advantages over time window-based feedforward networks. A recent model, “Long Short-Term Memory” (LSTM), is not affected by this problem. LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error flow through “constant error carrousels” (CECs) within special units, called cells — Felix A. Gers, et al., Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM , 2000 The two technical problems overcome by LSTMs are vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, both related to how the network is trained. Unfortunately, the range of contextual information that standard RNNs can access is in practice quite limited. The problem is that the influence of a given input on the hidden layer, and therefore on the network output, either decays or blows up exponentially as it cycles around the network’s recurrent connections. This shortcoming … referred to in the literature as the vanishing gradient problem … Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. — Alex Graves, et al., A Novel Connectionist System for Unconstrained Handwriting Recognition , 2009 The key to the LSTM solution to the technical problems was the specific internal structure of the units used in the model. … governed by its ability to deal with vanishing and exploding gradients, the most common challenge in designing and training RNNs. To address this challenge, a particular form of recurrent nets, called LSTM, was introduced and applied with great success to translation and sequence generation. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. How do LSTMs Work? Rather than go into the equations that govern how LSTMs are fit, analogy is a useful tool to quickly get a handle on how they work. We use networks with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer… The (fully) self-connected hidden layer contains memory cells and corresponding gate units… … Each memory cell’s internal architecture guarantees constant error flow within its constant error carrousel CEC… This represents the basis for bridging very long time lags. Two gate units learn to open and close access to error flow within each memory cell’s CEC. The multiplicative input gate affords protection of the CEC from perturbation by irrelevant inputs. Likewise, the multiplicative output gate protects other units from perturbation by currently irrelevant memory contents. — Sepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber, Long Short-Term Memory , 1997. Multiple analogies can help to give purchase on what differentiates LSTMs from traditional neural networks comprised of simple neurons. The Long Short Term Memory architecture was motivated by an analysis of error flow in existing RNNs which found that long time lags were inaccessible to existing architectures, because backpropagated error either blows up or decays exponentially. An LSTM layer consists of a set of recurrently connected blocks, known as memory blocks. These blocks can be thought of as a differentiable version of the memory chips in a digital computer. Each one contains one or more recurrently connected memory cells and three multiplicative units – the input, output and forget gates – that provide continuous analogues of write, read and reset operations for the cells. … The net can only interact with the cells via the gates. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. It is interesting to note, that even after more than 20 years, the simple (or vanilla) LSTM may still be the best place to start when applying the technique. The most commonly used LSTM architecture (vanilla LSTM) performs reasonably well on various datasets… Learning rate and network size are the most crucial tunable LSTM hyperparameters … … This implies that the hyperparameters can be tuned independently. In particular, the learning rate can be calibrated first using a fairly small network, thus saving a lot of experimentation time. — Klaus Greff, et al., LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey , 2015 What are LSTM Applications? It is important to get a handle on exactly what type of sequence learning problems that LSTMs are suitable to address. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can solve numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). … … LSTM holds promise for any sequential processing task in which we suspect that a hierarchical decomposition may exist, but do not know in advance what this decomposition is. — Felix A. Gers, et al., Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM , 2000 The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is neural sequence model that achieves state of the art performance on important tasks that include language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation. — Wojciech Zaremba, Recurrent Neural Network Regularization , 2014. Since LSTMs are effective at capturing long-term temporal dependencies without suffering from the optimization hurdles that plague simple recurrent networks (SRNs), they have been used to advance the state of the art for many difficult problems. This includes handwriting recognition and generation, language modeling and translation, acoustic modeling of speech, speech synthesis, protein secondary structure prediction, analysis of audio, and video data among others. — Klaus Greff, et al., LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey , 2015 What are Bidirectional LSTMs? A commonly mentioned improvement upon LSTMs are bidirectional LSTMs. The basic idea of bidirectional recurrent neural nets is to present each training sequence forwards and backwards to two separate recurrent nets, both of which are connected to the same output layer. … This means that for every point in a given sequence, the BRNN has complete, sequential information about all points before and after it. Also, because the net is free to use as much or as little of this context as necessary, there is no need to find a (task-dependent) time-window or target delay size. … for temporal problems like speech recognition, relying on knowledge of the future seems at first sight to violate causality … How can we base our understanding of what we’ve heard on something that hasn’t been said yet? However, human listeners do exactly that. Sounds, words, and even whole sentences that at first mean nothing are found to make sense in the light of future context. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. One shortcoming of conventional RNNs is that they are only able to make use of previous context. … Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) do this by processing the data in both directions with two separate hidden layers, which are then fed forwards to the same output layer. … Combining BRNNs with LSTM gives bidirectional LSTM, which can access long-range context in both input directions — Alex Graves, et al., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks , 2013 Unlike conventional RNNs, bidirectional RNNs utilize both the previous and future context, by processing the data from two directions with two separate hidden layers. One layer processes the input sequence in the forward direction, while the other processes the input in the reverse direction. The output of current time step is then generated by combining both layers’ hidden vector… — Di Wang and Eric Nyberg, A Long Short-Term Memory Model for Answer Sentence Selection in Question Answering , 2015 What are seq2seq LSTMs or RNN Encoder-Decoders? The sequence-to-sequence LSTM, also called encoder-decoder LSTMs, are an application of LSTMs that are receiving a lot of attention given their impressive capability. … a straightforward application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can solve general sequence to sequence problems. … The idea is to use one LSTM to read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, to obtain large fixed-dimensional vector representation, and then to use another LSTM to extract the output sequence from that vector. The second LSTM is essentially a recurrent neural network language model except that it is conditioned on the input sequence. The LSTM’s ability to successfully learn on data with long range temporal dependencies makes it a natural choice for this application due to the considerable time lag between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. We were able to do well on long sentences because we reversed the order of words in the source sentence but not the target sentences in the training and test set. By doing so, we introduced many short term dependencies that made the optimization problem much simpler. … The simple trick of reversing the words in the source sentence is one of the key technical contributions of this work — Ilya Sutskever, et al., Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks , 2014 An “encoder” RNN reads the source sentence and transforms it into a rich fixed-length vector representation, which in turn in used as the initial hidden state of a “decoder” RNN that generates the target sentence. Here, we propose to follow this elegant recipe, replacing the encoder RNN by a deep convolution neural network (CNN). … it is natural to use a CNN as an image “encoder”, by first pre-training it for an image classification task and using the last hidden layer as an input to the RNN decoder that generates sentences. — Oriol Vinyals, et al., Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator , 2014 … an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target sequence. — Kyunghyun Cho, et al., Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation , 2014 Summary In this post, you received a gentle introduction to LSTMs in the words of the research scientists that developed and applied the techniques.

Reply Jason Brownlee June 2, 2017 at 11:49 am # Yes, it is better tot use past observations as time steps when inputting to the model. Reply Dhineshkumar July 8, 2017 at 12:06 am # Hi Jason, Reply Jason Brownlee July 9, 2017 at 10:47 am # Yes, no fixed length input or output sequences. Reply Claudio July 11, 2017 at 8:33 am # Hello, good explanation and intoduction. model.add(LSTM(4)) model.add(Dense(1)) How many neurons I have on my input layers? I think the first line of code refer to the hidden layers, how things get in? Reply Jason Brownlee July 11, 2017 at 10:39 am # These are not input layers, but are instead hidden layers. You must specify the size of the expected input as an argument “input_shape=(xx,xx)” on the first hidden layer. The input_shape specifies a tuple that specifies the number of time steps and features. A feature is the number of observations taken at each time step. See this post for more: https://machinelearningmastery.com/5-step-life-cycle-long-short-term-memory-models-keras/ Does that help?

Reply Long October 23, 2017 at 9:30 am # Hi Jason, layers.LSTM(units=4, activation=’tanh’, dropout=0.1)(lstm_input) what does the units here mean? I put the units here equals neurons number of hidden layer. Am I right? But if the input sequence is smaller than the number of the units here (i.e. blocks/neuron), does ir mean that some neurons in the lstm layer have not input series, just pass states to the next neurons? Thanks a lot. Reply Jason Brownlee October 23, 2017 at 4:11 pm # Yes, you are correct. No, one unit can have many inputs. Further, the RNN only takes one time step as input at a time. Reply Long October 23, 2017 at 6:21 pm # Hi Jason, I still confused about this topic. Let me say: 28 steps series are input the LSTM layer, while there are 128 neuron. Does it mean 100 neurons have not input at this situation, just pass previous states to the next neurons? Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43034960/many-to-one-and-many-to-many-lstm-examples-in-keras , the green rectangles represent the LSTM blocks/neuron in keras, which is 128. The pink rectangles represent the input series, which is 28. And the blue rectangles represent the output series. Thank you very much. Jason Brownlee October 24, 2017 at 5:28 am # No, the number of time steps and number of units are not related. Long October 24, 2017 at 9:39 am # Hi Jason, Thanks for your answer. When we use layers.LSTM(units=128, activation=’tanh’, dropout=0.1)(lstm_input) does we mean there are 128 units in A (depicted in http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ )? If yes, what is the structure of such A like? Reply Jason Brownlee October 24, 2017 at 3:58 pm # 128 means 128 memory cells or neurons or what have you. I cannot speak to the pictures on another site. Perhaps contact their author? Reply Long October 25, 2017 at 1:06 pm # Thanks Jason. I just wanted to know the structure of the LSTM layer with 128 units, and the input and output. Reply Jason Brownlee October 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm # Generally, in Keras the shape of the input is defined by the output of the prior layer. The shape of the input to the network is specified on the visible layer or as an argument on the first hidden layer.

Does LSTM model require to have the same RNN/LSTM cell for each time step? What if my sequence is larger than the 128? From the RNN unfolding description, I found that each RNN/LSTM cell take one time step at time. This part confuse me a lot. Can you please clarify me? Reply Jason Brownlee October 16, 2018 at 6:33 am # No, the number of units in the first hidden layer is unrelated to the number of times steps in the input data. Reply Abdullah Al Mamun May 4, 2019 at 2:18 pm # Hello sir, What are the differences between time steps and time lags? I’m confused about these two terms. Also, what are the methods of finding optimal no of time lags in LSTM network? Reply Jason Brownlee May 5, 2019 at 6:23 am # A time step could be input or output, a lag is a time step from the past relative to the current observation or prediction. Trial and error is best we can do, perhaps informed by ACF/PACF plots.

Reply Rahul Krishnan February 21, 2020 at 6:46 pm # I have a question regarding the mapping of input to the hidden nodes in a seq2seq (encoder-decoder) model you talked about. Reading about it further I understand that the hidden nodes count are usually matched to the dimension of the vectorized input (read as a word is represented by it’s embedding), but this is usually not the case. So given the latter, if hidden node count is lesser than the dimension of the input, what is the mapping between the two. (is it maybe fully connected?) Understanding this mapping can help me better understand how the LSTM learns as a whole. Reply Jason Brownlee February 22, 2020 at 6:22 am # The encoding of the entire input sequence is used as a context in generating each step of the output sequence, regardless of how long it is.

Or consider the stride fixed at 1, e.g. one time step. You can achieve this effect using a CNN-LSTM. Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 3, 2020 at 5:00 am # Hi Jason. This is a great article. I follow your website to learn different Machine Learning Concepts and techniques. I am currently working on Binary Classification problem where data contains logs recorded at any point of time. each log record has multiple features with label as Pass/Fail. I used LSTM for such sequence classification. I want to understand how LSTM works internally for sequence classification problem. Could you please suggest some references for that? Thank You Reply Jason Brownlee September 3, 2020 at 6:10 am # This will help as a first step: https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/how-is-data-processed-by-an-lstm Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 3, 2020 at 7:47 am # Thank you Jason for quick reply. Here is what I understood: each node in the layer will get one time step of input sequence at a time,process it and give one output label(for Sequence Classification). Output of last time step from end of sequence will be used further. I am still curious how output vector from all nodes will be used later in the processing. Could you please elaborate more on it? Reply Jason Brownlee September 3, 2020 at 1:41 pm # The entire vector of outputs from layer is passed to the next layer for consideration, if return_sequences is true, otherwise the output from the last time step is passed to the next layer. This applies for each node in the layer. Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 5, 2020 at 7:57 am # Thank You Jason. I understood. As I mentioned earlier, I am currently working on Binary classification problem. I have one more question. Dataset contains storage drives(unique id) with multiple heads(one drive will have multiple records/1:many), each head will have multiple records of events with different time(unit hour). We can say it is time series data. Here Label for each record is PASS/FAIL head. Below is the snapshot of dataset. drive head time feature1 label 1. 0. t1 x PASS 1. 0. t2. y PASS 1. 1. t1. z. PASS 1. 2. t1. p. PASS 1. 2. t2. w. PASS 2. 0. t1. x. FAIL 2. 0. t2. y. FAIL Our goal is to predict drive will fail within next X hour. If we can predict pass/fail head then we can combine all head prediction and maximum prediction will be prediction of drive. We first converted this tabular data into 3D sequences for each unique drive, used LSTM as LSTM requires input in shape of (samples, time steps, features) My question is while preparing sequence for LSTM, Should it be for each drive or for each head? Also, once we get head level prediction, is there any other way to get drive level prediction? Thank You. Jason Brownlee September 5, 2020 at 8:09 am # Yes, I think each drive would be one sample to train the model. Yes, you can make a prediction by calling model.predict() this will help: https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-predictions-long-short-term-memory-models-keras/ Jaiminee Kataria September 17, 2020 at 3:49 am # Thank You Jason. This article helped me in the process. As I started adding more data, I see that it is severe imbalance between major(negative) and minor(positive) class. I am aware that SMOTE and it’s variation are best way to handle imbalance data but I am not able to figure out how I can use SMOTE with LSTM time series binary classification. Could you please suggest some reference or other technique I should use with LSTM for imbalance data? Thank You. Reply Jason Brownlee September 17, 2020 at 6:51 am # SMOTE is not appropriate for sequence data. Perhaps try designing your own sequence data augmentation generator? Reply Dhruv November 2, 2020 at 6:37 pm # Hello Jason, I had a question…. What information does the hidden state in an LSTM carry?

Reply Daniel February 5, 2021 at 1:39 am # Hi Jason, thanks for the detailed explanations! One short question: “A recurrent network whose inputs are not fixed but rather constitute an input sequence can be used to transform an input sequence into an output sequence while taking into account contextual information in a flexible way.” Why is a vanilla neural network restricted to a fixed input size, while a RNN is not? Could you elaborate on this with an example? Thanks a lot in advance! Reply Jason Brownlee February 5, 2021 at 5:43 am # You’re welcome.

Remember the crime documentaries where graphologist analyzes murder’s handwriting for finding the real culprit. Long gone are the days when all these nitty gritty tasks were in human hands, now artificial intelligence has taken over these assessments. In the modern era neural networks are assisting humans to survive the new age transitions in education, financial, aerospace and automotive sectors. But before knowing how they are giving different sectors a push, it is first important to understand the basic concept of neural networks and deep learning. Deep Learning Neural networks are a part of deep learning, which comes under the comprehensive term, artificial intelligence. Neural networks are a set of algorithms that are modelled after the human brain. These networks are also known as artificial neural networks (ANN). S ensory neurons, motor neurons and interneurons form the human brain . Artificial neurons, form the replica of the human brain (i.e. a neural network). Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a collection of connected units (nodes). These connected units are known as artificial neurons. These units closely resemble the original neurons of a human brain.  Every node is built with a set of inputs, weights, and a bias value. Weights of the neural network are held within the hidden layers. Weights and biases are learning parameters of machine learning models, they are modified for training the neural networks. Architecture of an artificial neural network Applications of Neural Networks Neural Networks are regulating some key sectors including finance, healthcare, and automotive. As these artificial neurons function in a way similar to the human brain. They can be used for image recognition, character recognition and stock market predictions. Let’s understand the diverse applications of neural networks 1. Facial Recognition Facial Recognition Systems are serving as robust systems of surveillance. Recognition Systems matches the human face and compares it with the digital images. They are used in offices for selective entries. The systems thus authenticate a human face and match it up with the list of IDs that are present in its database. (Must Check: Facial Recognition Work in Deep Learning? ) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used for facial recognition and image processing. Large number of pictures are fed into the database for training a neural network. The collected images are further processed for training. Sampling layers in CNN are used for proper evaluations. Models are optimized for accurate recognition results. (Related Blog: How does Basic Convolution Work for Image Processing? ) 2. Stock Market Prediction Investments are subject to market risks. It is nearly impossible to predict the upcoming changes in the highly volatile stock market. The forever changing bullish and bearish phases were unpredictable before the advent of neural networks. But well what changed it all? Neural Networks of course… To make a successful stock prediction in real time a Multilayer Perceptron MLP (class of feedforward artificial intelligence algorithm) is employed.  MLP comprises multiple layers of nodes, each of these layers is fully connected to the succeeding nodes. Stock’s past performances, annual returns, and non profit ratios are considered for building the MLP model. Check out this video to know how the LTSM model is built for making predictions in the stock market. 3. Social Media No matter how cliche it may sound, social media has altered the normal boring course of life. Artificial Neural Networks are used to study the behaviours of social media users. Data shared everyday via virtual conversations is tacked up and analyzed for competitive analysis. Neural networks duplicate the behaviours of social media users. Post analysis of individuals' behaviours via social media networks the data can be linked to people’s spending habits. Multilayer Perceptron ANN is used to mine data from social media applications. MLP forecasts social media trends, it uses different training methods like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). MLP takes into consideration several factors like user’s favourite instagram pages, bookmarked choices etc. These factors are considered as inputs for training the MLP model. In the ever changing dynamics of social media applications, artificial neural networks can definitely work as the best fit model for user data analysis.

Fault diagnosis, high performance auto piloting, securing the aircraft control systems, and modeling key dynamic simulations are some of the key areas that neural networks have taken over. Time delay Neural networks can be employed for modelling non linear time dynamic systems. Time Delay Neural Networks are used for position independent feature recognition. The algorithm thus built based on time delay neural networks can recognize patterns. (Recognizing patterns are automatically built by neural networks by copying the original data from feature units). Other than this TNN are also used to provide stronger dynamics to the NN models. As passenger safety is of utmost importance inside an aircraft, algorithms built using the neural network systems ensures the accuracy in the autopilot system. As most of the autopilot functions are automated, it is important to ensure a way that maximizes the security. Applications of neural networks 5. Defence Defence is the backbone of every country. Every country’s state in the international domain is assessed by its military operations. Neural Networks also shape the defence operations of technologically advanced countries. The United States of America, Britain, and Japan are some countries that use artificial neural networks for developing an active defence strategy. Neural networks are used in logistics, armed attack analysis, and for object location. They are also used in air patrols, maritime patrol, and for controlling automated drones. The defence sector is getting the much needed kick of artificial intelligence to scale up its technologies. Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), are employed for determining the presence of underwater mines. Underwater mines are the underpass that serve as an illegal commute route between two countries. Unmanned Airborne Vehicle (UAV), and Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) these autonomous sea vehicles use convolutional neural networks for the image processing. Convolutional layers form the basis of Convolutional Neural Networks. These layers use different filters for differentiating between images. Layers also have bigger filters that filter channels for image extraction. 6. Healthcare The age old saying goes like “Health is Wealth”. Modern day individuals are leveraging the advantages of technology in the healthcare sector. Convolutional Neural Networks are actively employed in the healthcare industry for X ray detection, CT Scan and ultrasound. As CNN is used in image processing, the medical imaging data retrieved from aforementioned tests is analyzed and assessed based on neural network models. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is also being employed for the development of voice recognition systems. (Must Check: Learning Recurrent Neural Network and applications ) Voice recognition systems are used these days to keep track of the patient’s data. Researchers are also employing Generative Neural Networks for drug discovery. Matching different categories of drugs is a hefty task, but generative neural networks have broken down the hefty task of drug discovery. They can be used for combining different elements which forms the basis of drug discovery. 7. Signature Verification and Handwriting Analysis Signature Verification , as the self explanatory term goes, is used for verifying an individual’s signature. Banks, and other financial institutions use signature verification to cross check the identity of an individual. Usually a signature verification software is used to examine the signatures. As cases of forgery are pretty common in financial institutions, signature verification is an important factor that seeks to closely examine the authenticity of signed documents. Artificial Neural Networks are used for verifying the signatures. ANN are trained to recognize the difference between real and forged signatures. ANNs can be used for the verification of both offline and online signatures. For training an ANN model, varied datasets are fed in the database. The data thus fed help the ANN model to differentiate. ANN model employs image processing for extraction of features. (Related Blog: Hand Gesture Classification using Deep Learning with Keras ) Handwriting analysis plays an integral role in forensics. The analysis is further used to evaluate the variations in two handwritten documents. The process of spilling words on a blank sheet is also used for behavioural analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used for handwriting analysis and handwriting verification. 8. Weather Forecasting The forecasts done by the meteorological department were never accurate before artificial intelligence came into force. Weather Forecasting is primarily undertaken to anticipate the upcoming weather conditions beforehand. In the modern era, weather forecasts are even used to predict the possibilities of natural disasters. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used for weather forecasting. Traditional ANN multilayer models can also be used to predict climatic conditions 15 days in advance. A combination of different types of neural network architecture can be used to predict air temperatures. (Must Check: Weather Forecasting Using Big Data Analytics ) Various inputs like air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiations were considered for training neural network based models. Combination models (MLP+CNN), (CNN+RNN) usually works better in the case of weather forecasting. Summing Up Neural Networks have a myriad of applications, from facial recognition to weather forecasting the interconnected layers (human brain’s replica), can do a lot of things with some simple inputs. ANN algorithms have simplified the assessment and modified the traditional algorithms. With humanoid robots like Grace on its way the world can expect some sci- fi movies turning into reality pretty soon!

Why Artificial Neural Networks? We need to understand the answer to the above question with an example of a human being. As a child, we used to learn the things with the help of our elders, which includes our parents or teachers. Then later by self-learning or practice we keep learning throughout our life. Scientists and researchers are also making the machine intelligent, just like a human being, and ANN plays a very important role in the same due to the following reasons − With the help of neural networks, we can find the solution of such problems for which algorithmic method is expensive or does not exist. Neural networks can learn by example, hence we do not need to program it at much extent. Neural networks have the accuracy and significantly fast speed than conventional speed. Areas of Application Followings are some of the areas, where ANN is being used. It suggests that ANN has an interdisciplinary approach in its development and applications. Speech Recognition Speech occupies a prominent role in human-human interaction. Therefore, it is natural for people to expect speech interfaces with computers. In the present era, for communication with machines, humans still need sophisticated languages which are difficult to learn and use. To ease this communication barrier, a simple solution could be, communication in a spoken language that is possible for the machine to understand. Great progress has been made in this field, however, still such kinds of systems are facing the problem of limited vocabulary or grammar along with the issue of retraining of the system for different speakers in different conditions. ANN is playing a major role in this area. Following ANNs have been used for speech recognition − Multilayer networks Multilayer networks with recurrent connections Kohonen self-organizing feature map The most useful network for this is Kohonen Self-Organizing feature map, which has its input as short segments of the speech waveform. It will map the same kind of phonemes as the output array, called feature extraction technique. After extracting the features, with the help of some acoustic models as back-end processing, it will recognize the utterance. Character Recognition It is an interesting problem which falls under the general area of Pattern Recognition. Many neural networks have been developed for automatic recognition of handwritten characters, either letters or digits. Following are some ANNs which have been used for character recognition − Multilayer neural networks such as Backpropagation neural networks. Neocognitron Though back-propagation neural networks have several hidden layers, the pattern of connection from one layer to the next is localized. Similarly, neocognitron also has several hidden layers and its training is done layer by layer for such kind of applications. Signature Verification Application Signatures are one of the most useful ways to authorize and authenticate a person in legal transactions. Signature verification technique is a non-vision based technique. For this application, the first approach is to extract the feature or rather the geometrical feature set representing the signature. With these feature sets, we have to train the neural networks using an efficient neural network algorithm. This trained neural network will classify the signature as being genuine or forged under the verification stage. Human Face Recognition It is one of the biometric methods to identify the given face. It is a typical task because of the characterization of “non-face” images. However, if a neural network is well trained, then it can be divided into two classes namely images having faces and images that do not have faces. First, all the input images must be preprocessed. Then, the dimensionality of that image must be reduced. And, at last it must be classified using neural network training algorithm. Following neural networks are used for training purposes with preprocessed image − Fully-connected multilayer feed-forward neural network trained with the help of back-propagation algorithm. For dimensionality reduction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used.

[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence . Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data , in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. [2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering , speech recognition , agriculture , and computer vision , where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. [3] [4] A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics , which focuses on making predictions using computers, but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning . [6] [7] Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain . [8] [9] In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics .

These inferences can be obvious, such as ""since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well"". They can be nuanced, such as ""X% of families have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered black swans exist"". [10] Machine learning programs can perform tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves computers learning from data provided so that they carry out certain tasks. For simple tasks assigned to computers, it is possible to program algorithms telling the machine how to execute all steps required to solve the problem at hand; on the computer's part, no learning is needed. For more advanced tasks, it can be challenging for a human to manually create the needed algorithms. In practice, it can turn out to be more effective to help the machine develop its own algorithm, rather than having human programmers specify every needed step. [11] The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available. In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid. This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers. For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used. [11] History and relationships to other fields [ edit ] See also: Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [12] [13] Also the synonym self-teaching computers were used in this time period. [14] [15] By the early 1960s an experimental ""learning machine"" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning . It was repetitively ""trained"" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a "" goof "" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. [16] A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. [17] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. [18] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. [19] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: ""A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E ."" [20] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper "" Computing Machinery and Intelligence "", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"". [21] Modern-day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions. [22] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] Machine learning as subfield of AI [23] Part of machine learning as subfield of AI or part of AI as subfield of machine learning [24] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. In the early days of AI as an academic discipline , some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed "" neural networks ""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics. [25] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis . [26] : 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation. [26] : 488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor. [27] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming , but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [26] : 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "" connectionism "", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield , Rumelhart , and Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [26] : 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic , and probability theory . [27] The difference between ML and AI is frequently misunderstood. ML learns and predicts based on passive observations, whereas AI implies an agent interacting with the environment to learn and take actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. [28] As of 2020, many sources continue to assert that ML remains a subfield of AI. [29] [30] [27] Others have the view that not all ML is part of AI, but only an 'intelligent subset' of ML should be considered AI. [5] [31] [32] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Optimization [ edit ] Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization : many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). [33] Generalization [ edit ] The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples. Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms. Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns. [34] According to Michael I. Jordan , the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics. [35] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field. [35] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, [29] wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [30] Theory [ edit ] Main articles: Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience. [5] [31] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the Probably Approximately Correct Learning (PAC) model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error . For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer. [32] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches [ edit ] Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system: Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ). Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize. [5] Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Supervised learning A support-vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. [36] The data is known as training data , and consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimization of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. [37] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. [20] Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning , classification and regression . [28] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Unsupervised learning See also: Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points. The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics , such as finding the probability density function . [38] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features. Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation , the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article: Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. [39] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimization , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. [40] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reduction [ edit ] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. [41] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the ""number of features"". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). This results in a smaller dimension of data (2D instead of 3D), while keeping all original variables in the model without changing the data. [42] The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization . Other types [ edit ] Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example topic modeling , meta-learning . [43] As of 2022, deep learning is the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning. [11] Self-learning [ edit ] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). [44] It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. [45] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive consequence situation s' compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s') update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. [46] Feature learning [ edit ] Main article: Feature learning Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. [47] Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorization [48] and various forms of clustering . [49] [50] [51] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. [52] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. [53] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions , and is assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately. [54] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. [55] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article: Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. [56] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. [57] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. [58] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. [59] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning [ edit ] Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, [60] [61] and finally meta-learning (e.g. MAML). Association rules [ edit ] Main article: Association rule learning See also: Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"". [62] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. [63] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning, and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. [64] For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } {\displaystyle \{\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \}\Rightarrow \{\mathrm {burger} \}} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements . In addition to market basket analysis , association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics . In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm , with a learning component, performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , or unsupervised learning . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions. [65] Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. [66] [67] [68] Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. [69] The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. Models [ edit ] Performing machine learning involves creating a model , which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems. Artificial neural networks [ edit ] Main article: Artificial neural network See also: Deep learning An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain . Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains . Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "" artificial neurons "", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain . Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain , can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number , and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology . Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision , speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis . Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition . [70] A decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Titanic . Decision trees [ edit ] Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers ) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making . In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Support-vector machines [ edit ] Main article: Support-vector machine Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. [71] An SVM training algorithm is a non- probabilistic , binary , linear classifier , although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick , implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Illustration of linear regression on a data set Regression analysis [ edit ] Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression , where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares . The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression . When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel [72] ), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification ) or even kernel regression , which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. Bayesian networks [ edit ] Main article: Bayesian network A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences , are called dynamic Bayesian networks . Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams . An example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models. [73] Gaussian processes [ edit ] Main article: Gaussian processes A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution , and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function , or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data, can be directly computed by looking as the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization . Genetic algorithms [ edit ] Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection , using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. [74] [75] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms . [76] Training models [ edit ] Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data in order for the models to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably be integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learning [ edit ] Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google . [77] Applications [ edit ] There are many applications for machine learning, including: Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive website Affective computing Astronomy Automated decision-making Banking Behaviorism Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen Science Climate Science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis [78] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Knowledge graph embedding Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time-series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first "" Netflix Prize "" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs -Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1  million. [79] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. [80] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis. [81] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems , Vinod Khosla , predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. [82] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists. [83] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning. [84] In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. [85] Machine learning is recently applied to predict the green behavior of human-being. [86] Recently, machine learning technology is also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone. [87] [88] [89] Limitations [ edit ] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. [90] [91] [92] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems. [93] In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. [94] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. [95] [96] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves. [97] Bias [ edit ] Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society. [98] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. [99] [100] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people. [101] [102] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas, [103] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all. [104] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems. [105] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. [106] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. [107] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li , who reminds engineers that ""There's nothing artificial about AI...It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility."" [108] Explainability [ edit ] Main article: Explainable artificial intelligence Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Overfitting [ edit ] Main article: Overfitting The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is. [10] Other limitations and vulnerabilities [ edit ] Learners can also disappoint by ""learning the wrong lesson"". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. [109] A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often don't primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in ""adversarial"" images that the system misclassifies. [110] [111] Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification. [ citation needed ] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and/or evasion via adversarial machine learning . [112] Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g. for categories ""spam"" and well-visible ""not spam"" of posts) machine learning models which are often developed and/or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access . [113] [114] [115] Model assessments [ edit ] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold- cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap , which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy. [116] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC). [117] Ethics [ edit ] See also: AI control problem and Toronto Declaration Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions . Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use ( algorithmic bias ), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. [118] For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to be either women or had non-European sounding names. [98] Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. [119] [120] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information. These decisions rely on the objectivity and logical reasoning. [121] Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases. [122] [123] Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. [124] This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increase profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated. [125] Hardware [ edit ] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units. [126] By 2019, graphic processing units ( GPUs ), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. [127] OpenAI estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. [128] [129] Neuromorphic/Physical Neural Networks [ edit ] A physical neural network or Neuromorphic computer is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse . ""Physical"" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse. [130] [131] Embedded Machine Learning [ edit ] Embedded Machine Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers , edge devices and microcontrollers . [132] [133] [134] Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing, henceforth, reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data, and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties, personal data and business secrets. Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration , [135] [136] using approximate computing , [137] optimization of machine learning models and many more.

In this guide, we will cover basic as well as advanced topics involved in Deep Learning. This guide will help you in gaining confidence in the concepts of Deep Learning. So let’s begin with our journey! Why do we need Deep Learning? The problem In traditional programming, the programmer formulates rules and conditions in their code that their program can then use to predict or classify in the correct manner. For example, normally to build a classifier, a programmer comes up with a set of rules, and program those rules. Then when you want to classify things, you give it a piece of data, and rules are used to select the category. This approach might be successful for a variety of problems. But remember NOT ALL! How? Let’s see. Image classification is one such problem that cannot be resolved using the traditional programming method. Imagine how would you write the code for image classification? How could a programmer write rules and regulations to predict images they have never seen before? Solution Found! What is it? Deep learning is the solution to the above problem. It is a very efficient technique in pattern recognition by trial and error. With the help of a deep neural network, we can train the network by providing a huge amount of data and providing feedback on its performance, the network can identify, through a huge amount of iteration, its own set of conditions by which it can act in the correct way. A SIMPLE MODEL: WITH ONE NEURON Let’s begin understanding the neural network with the simplest model that can be made. The neuron is usually represented by circles with one arrow pointing outward and one inward. Here, in the above diagram, ‘m’ is the slope of the line, ‘x’ is the input value and ‘b’ is the constant, for the equation, y = m.x + b. Note the difference between ‘y_hat’ and ‘y’ variables. ‘y_hat’ is the prediction that we have made using the equation called estimated value whereas ‘y’ is the actual value or true value. Let’s see how this simple model works! We will start assigning random values to ‘m’ (usually between -1 and 1) and ‘b’, and then calculate ‘y_hat’ with the ‘x’ as input values. In the above figure, (x, y_hat) is plotted and a regression line is drawn. Since ‘m’ and ‘b’ were given random values, there is supposed to be an error in the estimated value from the true value. Thus, the error is calculated as the average of the square of the difference between the expected value and true value i.e. Here MSE (mean squared error) is being used but one can also use RMSE i.e. root mean squared error, which is nothing but the root of MSE. MSE basically indicates how far is the expected value from the target/ true value. If MSE is plotted on a 3D graph, it looks like the image given below: http://www.adeveloperdiary.com/data-science/how-to-visualize-gradient-descent-using-contour-plot-in-python/ The aim of any model is to minimize the error. Hence, the minimum of the curve is at the bottom of the curve. In order to reach there, we have to use calculus for that.  Gradient Descent is the method for finding out the minimum of this loss curve. It looks like the following graphs: So how it works? The computer doesn’t have an eyeball like humans which does not have the ability to guestimate the path to reach the target variable from the current position. It calculates the gradient, which is the fancy word to describe multivariate slope which figures out the direction of slope, which is some ratio of the variable ‘b’ to ‘m’. Now the direction to travel is known. The next step is to determine how far it has to travel to reach the target point. This is known as the ‘learning rate’. Usually, the learning rate is not taken to be a bigger value as it will mean that one is moving away from the target. A too-small learning rate is also a problem since it will take a longer time for computation. There are a few ways to measure the progress of the algorithm. There are epochs which mean a model update with the full dataset. Instead of epochs, nowadays people use a more efficient technique that is batch which means the sample of the full dataset. In either case, the step is either the full dataset or a batch, calculate the gradient, and update the parameters with the gradient and learning rate. Thus, the process is continued till the target value is achieved. This is how gradient descent works! BUILDING A NETWORK: FROM NEURONS TO NETWORK in the earlier example, only one input was considered for the neuron. Now, more inputs can be considered for one neuron. From now onwards, instead of having single x input to the neuron with slope ‘m’, multiple inputs (i.e. x1,x2,x3…so on) will be considered with their respective weights (i.e. w1, w2, w3…so on).  Not only this, there is one more interesting thing! The output of one neuron can be used as input to another neuron. This is applicable as long as it does not make a loop. When an error is calculated from new weights using gradient descent an error calculated from the later neuron can be used as part of the error of the previous neuron it’s connected to. Gotcha! Now is the right time to introduce the concept of the Activation Function here. ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS There are only three types of activation functions i.e. Linear, ReLU, and Sigmoid. Linear Activation Function is one of the basic activation functions. This is used widely because it is fast, as it is linear in nature and hence easy to differentiate. The graph and equation of this function look like the images shown below: One easy way to add non linearity is to feed the equation of a line into another non-linear function. The most popular function is ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit. It is one of the fancy ways of saying that whenever the output of the line is negative, it is going to set it to 0. It can be represented as follows: Another activation function is the Sigmoid function. This is an ‘S’ plot curve that goes from 0 to 1. This is the most prominent function and is widely in Logistic Regression. The result of this function gives the probability which has to lie between 0 to 1. OVERFITTING Why shouldn’t the programmer make a big neural network and solve every problem?  Can one think of the pitfalls of having a large model with lots of neurons? One problem is that there will be a lot of wastage of computational resources, and the other could be the longer time to train the model. Ugh! There is one more point. The problem is related to classical statistics. Let’s say, two models have been built, as shown below: Which of the two models proves to be the best? One that is located on the left side. Why? look at the RMSE value. The left model has a better RMSE value than the right one. But that is not true! Why? Let’s see. What if we get new sample data that the model has not already seen by the model? The left model would give a very poor result i.e. the RMSE will be very high as compared to the right side model. This is because the left side model has memorized the points and thus provided excellent RMSE during training. On the other hand, the right-side model is more generalized. Thus, the left hand side model is said to be the overfitted model. Thus, the choice depends on the Data Scientist to choose the type of model suitable with respect to their needs. Now let’s create one project to understand the concepts much better : Project Name : American Sign Language Dataset Objectives: 1. Prepare the image data and use it for training the model 2. Create and compile the basic model for image classification Project begins: American Sign Language Dataset is a very common dataset and can be found on Kaggle for practice. It consists of 26 letters out of which the letters ‘j’ and ‘k’ are not considered in the training because they require movement. Their classification is beyond the scope of this guide. Let’s start with the coding part! Loading the Data Reading in the Data: The sign dataset, that has been downloaded from Kaggle, is in the CSV (stands for comma-separated value) format. CSV file has rows and columns which consists of labels mentioned at the top. One can check the difference between the CSV file and XLSX file by opening them in the text (.txt) format on a usual notepad. In the CSV file, the values in a row are separated by commas. To load and work with the data, the Pandas library would be used, which is one the best tools to work with huge data and help is easy manipulation of data. CSV files will be read in the format of Dataframe from pandas library. import pandas as pd train_df = pd.read_csv(""sign_mnist_train.csv"") valid_df = pd.read_csv(""sign_mnist_valid.csv"") Exploring the Data Now it’s time to visualize the data. The data can be visualized by using the head method of the pandas data frame. Each row has some integer values which are nothing but the image pixel’s intensity. The data has a column labeled mentioned which refers to the true value of each image. train_df.head() Output: Extracting the Labels Now, the training and validation labels will be stored in a variable called y_train and y_label variables. The code for their construction can be referred to below: y_train = train_df[‘label’] y_valid = valid_df['label'] del train_df['label'] del valid_df['label'] Extracting the Images Now, previously labels were stored in the variable. Now, the training and validation images dataset will be stored in a variable called x_train and x_valid respectively. x_train = train_df.values x_valid = valid_df.values Summarizing the Training and Validation Data Now, the program has 27,455 images with 784 pixels each for training… x_train.shape …as well as their corresponding labels: y_train.shape For validation, it has 7,172 images… x_valid.shape …and their corresponding labels: y_valid.shape Visualizing the Data To visualize the images, now use the matplotlib library. Here there is no need to worry about the details of this visualization. Note that data will have to be reshaped from its current 1D shape of 784 pixels to a 2D shape of 28×28 pixels to make sense of the image: mport matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.figure(figsize=(40,40)) ​num_images = 20 for i in range(num_images): row = x_train[i] label = y_train[i] image = row.reshape(28,28) plt.subplot(1, num_images, i+1) plt.title(label, fontdict={'fontsize': 30}) plt.axis('off') plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray') Normalize the Image Data Deep learning models are much better and very efficient at dealing with floating-point numbers between 0 and 1. The Conversion of integer values to floating-point values between 0 and 1 is called normalization. Normalization is a very essential concept that one should be aware of. Now it’s time to normalize the image data, meaning that their pixel values, instead of being between 0 and 255 as they are currently: x_train.min() x_train.max() …should be floating-point values between 0 and 1. It is coded as follows: x_train = x_train / 255 x_valid = x_valid / 255 Categorize the Labels What is categorical encoding? Consider the case, if someone asks, what is 7-2? If you said that digit 4 is much closer to the answer than digit 9. Unfortunately, this does not happen in neural networks used for image classification. The neural networks should not have this kind of reasoning and it should clearly make a difference that guessing the image as 4, which is actually 5, is equivalently bad as guessing 9. We can see that images are labeled between 0 to 9. Since these are numerical values, the model thus created should try to categorize them perfectly into ten categories. Since it was previously mentioned that labels are values, it is required for them to get converted into categories. For this, category encoding is used, which modifies the data so that each label belongs to its possible category. The keras.utils.to_categorical method will be used to accomplish this. import tensorflow.keras as keras num_classes = 24 y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes) y_valid = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_valid, num_classes) Build the Model The data is all prepared, we have normalized images for training and validation, as well as categorically encoded labels for training and validation. With the training data that we prepared earlier, it is now time to create the model that will train with the data. This first basic model will be made up of several layers and will be comprised of 3 main parts: An input layer, the layer which receives all data as input Several hidden layers, each made up of many neurons . Each neuron will have its weight associated with it such that it will affect the performance and accuracy of the model. An output layer, which will depict the network’s guess for a given image The units argument specifies the number of neurons in the layer. The activation function concept has already been taught above. from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(units = 512, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,))) model.add(Dense(units = 512, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(units = num_classes, activation='softmax')) Summarizing the Model The below code will give the way to summarize the model: model.summary() Compiling the Model Time to compile our model with the same options, using categorical cross-entropy to ensure that we want to fit into one of many categories, and measure the accuracy of our model: model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) Train the Model Use the model’s fit method to train it for 20 epochs using the training and validation images and labels created above: model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, verbose=1, validation_data=(x_valid, y_valid)) Now one can see the training of the model for 20 epochs. The accuracy turns out to be 97% approximately which is quite good. So, this was all about Deep learning techniques.

But it fell short of the opening day totals of Doctor Strange 2 and Thor 4. By: Entertainment Desk Mumbai | Updated: November 12, 2022 1:50:28 pm A still from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever , the sequel to Marvel Studios’ Academy Award-winning film Black Panther (2018), released in India on November 11. Early estimates suggest that the film had a good start at the box office, as it grossed Rs 15.05 crore on day one. The collection suggests that the film has faired way better than all non-Marvel Hollywood films released this year. According to a Deadline report, Black Panther 2 has already earned $58.8 million globally, and will see a tremendous growth over this weekend as the franchise has a huge fan following in India, where it release yesterday. However, the film has opened lower than fellow Marvel sequels Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Thor: Love and Thunder, the two other MCU films that released earlier this year. According to Bollywood Hungama, Doctor Strange 2, which was released in May, had earned Rs 28.35 crore on its opening day, whereas Thor: Love And Thunder, which was released in July, had earned Rs 18.20 crores.

After all, this one is a well mounted film and of course needs good returns theatrically as well. Moreover, the strategy of giving a controlled release to the film would also pay off only if there is a constant increase in numbers on a day by day basis, including weekdays which have to better than Friday. Well, in that aspect, the Sooraj Barjatya directed film did succeed as it saw a huge jump in numbers with 3.64 crores coming in. The collections had to double up, considering the fact that despite a small release, it wasn’t as if the Parineeti Chopra starrer was showing full houses everywhere on Friday. Hence, capacity was there which means there was scope for the film to grow big. That indeed happened on Saturday which is such good news because otherwise films have typically seen only 20%-25% jumps in 2022 even with a low opening. Advertisement Advertisement Uunchai has collected 5.45 crores so far and a similar kind of jump would be required on Sunday as well, considering screens and shows could well be increased. The film should cross 4.50 crores mark today but what would indeed help is a score in the excess of 5 crores as that would mean a major shift in gears when compared to Friday numbers [ 1.81 crores ]. Once that happens, the base would be set for consistent footfalls from Monday.

Slash prices Akshay Kumar at the summit said that prices of making a movie and the subsequent ticketing needs to be reduced by at least 30-40%. He said that actors need to charge less money, prices of tickets need to be reduced and the overall money it requires in the making of a cinema needs to be reduced for cinema goers to return to cinema halls. “You have to do this if you want the public to come back to the theatre,"" he added. Muti-cast ensemble Akshay Kumar further said that any movie will reach the ‘epic’ standard only when it is multi-cast. Taking the example of Marvel movies, Kumar said, “Look at Hollywood, what kind of movies they’re bringing. It’s Marvel movies where everyone comes together and people want to see that. They want to experience and enjoy. The audience wants a story and much more. They don’t want to just give their money, they want a value for it,"" he said. “We need to all get together and do big cinema"". Ram Charan concurred. “You have to rethink and restructure the whole game moving forward, from the script to the making to the exhibitor. Everyone has to pitch in. Eventually, a good subject and a good script cannot be stopped. People will come to the theatre,"" Charan said. Cater to changing audience taste Both Akshay Kumar and Ram Charan added that the film industry needs to acknowledge and work around their audience's changing taste and viewing habits. From a rampant shift to OTT platforms to larger-than-life movies, both actors stressed that audience preferences have changed. “It’s very tricky at the moment. People require to see larger-than-life, an epic film like RRR or Sooryavanshi…I think people want to watch that big cinema and we have to try to start making that. You have to cater to OTT also and cinema going audience also. I just hope one day, people come for all kinds of cinema,"" Kumar said. Just call it 'Indian Cinema' “This whole thing of Telugu cinema, Tamil cinema, Hindi cinema, Gujarati cinema – why can’t we just call it Indian cinema? I would prefer it like that"" Akshay Kumar said to the audience when Ram Charan noted that event hough at a point it was Rajinikanth and Kamaal Hassan, now all actors have become one unit -the Indian Cinema Unit. “Of course, Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan ji also travelled across and did very well. My dad also did a couple of films. But today, we have become one unit – the Indian cinema unit,"" Ram Charan said. The last couple of yearsa number of Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, and Kannada movies have achieved national success. RRR -- which starred Charan and NTR Junior collected over ₹ 1,200 crore at the box office – was only the latest film in this string of successes.

4,Anya Taylor-Joy rejected Disney for this role: Find out,"Home Constituencies Candidates Results Home Geo Urdu latest pakistan world sports showbiz entertainment business health Sci-Tech Food Fact Check big picture Videos shows Geo Asool Contact us X Home Latest Pakistan World Sports showbiz Fact Check big picture Videos Entertainment TV Shows Business Sci-Tech entertainment Sunday Nov 13 2022 By Web Desk Home Entertainment Anya Taylor-Joy rejected Disney for this role: Find out By Web Desk Sunday Nov 13, 2022 Anya Taylor-Joy rejected Disney for this role: Find out Anya Taylor-Joy rejected Disney’s offer to star in Robert Eggers’ The Witch as get a good feeling about it, the actress shared in a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar magazine via Variety. The actress was offered to star in a pilot for Disney Channel which she got on the same day as the said movie. Premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2015, The Witch is the horror movie that gave Taylor-Joy her first acting break. “I remember it was the same day I got asked to be in a Disney Channel pilot, and it was so exciting to be offered anything at all that I ran around the house like a loon,” Taylor-Joy said. “But I just had this really good feeling about ‘The Witch’ that made me willing to forego the Disney experience for the thing that felt unknown to me, the thing that felt sacred.” However, the actress, 26, wasn’t as confident for her performance in the movie. According to the outlet while Anya gave a compelling performance as an innocent young girl, who gradually succumbs to the forces of evil around her, was surprised that the movie garnered critical acclaim. “I thought I’d done a really bad job, and I saw myself failing miserably with this dream I’d had for such a long time,"" she shared. ""I guess I’m not always the best judge of my own work."" The Queen’s Gambit star still holds the role very close to her heart. “It gave me the cornerstones of the way I work now, which is essentially the idea that there is no hierarchy on set: you work hard, you stay on top of the shots and you don’t assume anyone else is going to do that for you,"" she added. ""Your title doesn’t stop at actor – you’re a creative on this film, and that’s how you need to approach it.” Taylor-Joy recently wrapped production on George Miller’s Furiosa , a prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road that Warner Bros. is set to release in theatres on May 24, 2024.

The formal announcement comes only a week after RM teased the project while speaking to Pharrell Williams for the November 2022 cover of Rolling Stone . The producer hinted that RM was “90 per cent done” with the album, and he expressed interest in collaborating with the BTS member to finish the last 10 per cent. Looks like we've finally that reached 100 per cent, as RM took to social media on November 10 to reveal the title and release date of his first solo album. BigHit Music also made the announcement via Weverse. With a simple post of what looks like a close-up image of denim, RM dropped the big news: “‘Indigo’ RM 1st Solo Album, 12/2.” Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. For RM, whose real name is Kim Namjoon, Indigo will be his first official solo album but his third solo release to date. He previously released two mixtapes, 2015's RM and 2018's mono . According to a press release from HYBE, Indigo “recounts the stories and experiences RM has gone through, like a diary. The album will present a different charm of RM with various featured artists.” RM's Indigo is set to arrive on December 2, the next exciting release from the group's solo-focused phase of their journey. (ICYMI: Earlier this summer BTS announced they would be moving into a new chapter of their career that focused more on solo projects from the group 's members.) Mark your calendars now, and hopefully Pharrell will be next in line to announce the release date of his collaboration album Phriends ; we need that Pharrell feat. BTS record now !

Suresh Prabhu Related The unique opportunity that G20 presidency offers India to drive a global narrative For the first time India will host the G20 , which has emerged as one of the most important groupings in the world as its members belong to both advanced and emerging economies representing about 85% of the world’s GDP (gross domestic product). India is assuming the presidency at a time when multilateralism itself is under a severe challenge. Some multilateral bodies have turned ineffective. Also, there are challenges arising out of the war in Ukraine and the way China has asserted itself. The next week’s summit in Indonesia is already witnessing some hiccups. The coming year, too, will remain challenging. India will have to navigate geopolitical, financial, social and climate-related challenges. It will have to deal with one more key issue — energy transition (from fossil fuels to renewables). Also Read: The unique opportunity that G20 presidency offers India to drive a global narrative As a former sherpa who has participated in several G20 discussions (2014-16 and 2019-21), I have always maintained that the countries negotiating in a G20 room must also think about the rest of the world, which contributes only 15% to the world’s GDP. We have a responsibility towards those who are not in the room. During its presidency, India must consider this aspect seriously. After all, traditionally, we have had very good relationship with many of the least developed countries. G20 must remember that the priorities of those countries are quite different. As every presidency has a prerogative to set its own agenda, there is scope for new priorities. India’s target during its presidency should be to have some tangible outcomes. The advantage is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is well-versed in global issues. India should shape a global agenda in the next year. There must be emphasis on engagement groups, which ultimately feed important inputs to leaders. One of the characteristics of G20 is that it does not have a permanent secretariat. So the institutional memories of G20 are very limited. India should offer a permanent framework— some sort of an architecture, physical or digital — under which all proceedings of G20 can be documented. That will help subsequent presidencies, too. That, I feel, could be one of India’s contributions to the world. — As told to Shantanu Nandan Sharma ( Originally published on Nov 12, 2022 ) Read More News on suresh prabhu g20 india at g20 india g20 presidency g20 meeting modi (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Read Today's Paper India for phase-down of all fossil fuels, not just coal SECTIONS India for phase-down of all fossil fuels, not just coal By Urmi Goswami , ET Bureau Last Updated: Nov 13, 2022, 07:10 AM IST Rate Story Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Last year in Glasgow, India had raised the issue of needing to phase-out all fossil fuel as against singling out one category of fossil fuel, namely coal. This was perceived as a defensive response to the growing calls ""for ending the use of coal"", and did not garner any support, observers said. Getty Images At the UN Climate Change Conference , India has argued that the world must phase-down all fossil fuels , and not just coal , to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. This proposal was made as part of the 'cover decision', a political agreement that the host country pilots encapsulating issues not necessarily part of the official agenda. Last year in Glasgow, India had raised the issue of needing to phase-out all fossil fuel as against singling out one category of fossil fuel, namely coal. This was perceived as a defensive response to the growing calls ""for ending the use of coal"", and did not garner any support, observers said. At Sharm El Sheikh, India is proactively pushing for a decision that would commit all countries to plan an exit from the use of fossil fuels -gas, oil as well as coal. Indian negotiators have reached out to other countries with the proposal. The hope is that ""weaponisation"" of energy by Russia in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine might lead to more takers for the Indian intervention. The proposal acknowledges that a move away from fossil fuels will be gradual and in line with national circumstances, hence the phrase ""phase down"" as against a phase out, and does not have any target date. It urges all countries to accelerate transition to clean energy and to acknowledge that all fossil fuels contribute to global warming, while recognising that the shift will have to consider national circumstances. India has argued that singling out one type of fossil fuel and labelling it as harmful while promoting and accepting the use of other fossil fuels is not based on facts. There is an equity aspect to it as well. Coal use is mostly concentrated in developing countries while use of gas is more prevalent in rich industrialised countries. Singling out coal puts a bigger burden on poor developing countries while giving countries with greater resources more leeway in planning out their transition to clean energy.

He mistakenly thanked Colombia instead of Cambodia for hosting the ASEAN Summit. ""It was an honour to host at the White House in May, and now that we are back together in Cambodia,"" the US President said as he opened the talks. ""I look forward to building even stronger progress than we've already made. I want to thank the prime minister for Colombia's leadership as ASEAN chair,"" he added.

Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada is projected to defeat Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, who was endorsed by former US president Donald Trump, while Senator Mark Kelly is set to defeat Republican Blake Masters in Arizona. The result means the Democrats will now have 50 seats in the 100-member Senate - with the Republicans currently on 49. Georgia is still waiting on a Senate result and will hold a run-off election on December 6, after neither candidate won an outright majority.

Read here The United States Senate has 100 seats and in the existing Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans had 50 members each with Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democratic, casting her vote in case of a tie, in her capacity as its chairperson. ""This election is a victory,"" a victory and a vindication for Democrats, our agenda,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters in New York. He described it as a victory for the American people. ""Once again President Biden defied expectations. These midterm election results show best midterm performance for an incumbent President's party in 20 years since George W Bush's GOP gained seats following 9/11,"" Ajay Bhutoria, deputy National Finance Chair of the Democratic National Committee, told PTI on Saturday after the Nevada election results. Before the elections, political pundits and pollsters predicted a ""red wave"" which was not to be seen anywhere during the November 8 midterm polls. Four days after the elections, the opposition Republican party is struggling to gain the majority in the House of Representatives, which as per the pollsters, looked like a wave for them. As of Saturday night, the Republicans had either won or were leading in 213 seats as against 203 of the Democratic Party, with 218 being the halfway mark. This better-than-expected performance by the Democrats is attributed to the people-friendly policies of President Biden and the tilt of the youth towards him. The victory is a major boost to President Biden in the second half of his term, both for his legislative agenda and his ability to appoint judges and other officials. ""Under President Biden's leadership, Democrats have shown surprising strength. Democrats have also been successful in governors' races, winning in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania and the Senate seat in Pennsylvania,"" Bhutoria said. ""With votes still being counted across the country, Republicans still have the opportunity to win control of Congress. But the results are uplifting for Democrats who were braced for sweeping losses,"" he said. ""This is the first time we have an Indian American Lt Governor in Maryland - Aruna Miller and we also have 5th Indian American congressman in the house -Shri Thanedar. Overall, people voted for President Biden's call to save and protect the Democracy, abortion rights and economy, restoring the soul of our nation,"" Bhutoria said. The New York Times described the Saturday results as ""a decisive moment in an extraordinary midterm election in which Democrats defied historical patterns and predictions of major losses."" Control of the House has still not been decided, several days after an Election Day that fell short of predictions that Republicans would sweep to power in Washington in a repudiation of President Biden's leadership, the daily reported. The Washington Post described it as welcome news for Biden, who it said was staring down the possibility of humbling defeats as the election neared. ""Now, the Senate, which oversees the confirmation of executive branch personnel and federal judges, will stay in his party's corner. A Senate majority will also give the president and his party more say over legislative debates on domestic and foreign spending and other major issues,"" the daily reported. According to Republican Sampat Shivangi, national president of the Indian American Forum for Political Education, the elections brought surprising and unexpected results. ""It was assumed that Republicans will have a heyday and win easily both the House, and Senate and President Trump will ride the wave and announce his candidacy for Presidency in 2024,"" he noted. However, the performance of the Republican Party has been far below expectations.

Advertisement Reuters Phnom Penh , UPDATED: Nov 13, 2022 15:31 IST Joe Biden during his visit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia November 13. (Reuters) By Reuters : Joe Biden said on Sunday he was ""incredibly pleased"" with the turnout in the US election after Democrats clinched control of the Senate, a major victory for the president as he looks to his next two years in office. Speaking to reporters in Cambodia ahead of an East Asia Summit, Biden said the turnout was a reflection of the quality of candidates his party was fielding after Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was projected to win re-election in Nevada, narrowly beating Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. A Democratic victory in a Georgia runoff next month would then give the party outright majority control of a 51-49 Senate, while a Georgia defeat would still keep Democrats in charge of a 50-50 Senate, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris able to break tie votes. The additional seat would mean Democrats could spare a vote on key nominations and bills.

And I think it's a reflection of the quality of our candidates."" Control of the House of Representatives has still not been decided. Biden acknowledged such a victory would be ""a stretch"" for the Democrats, but Republicans have fallen well short of predictions they would sweep to power in Washington. Biden had framed the midterm election as a test of US democracy at a time when hundreds of Republican candidates embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Trump has repeatedly used his appeal among hard-right conservatives to influence candidates nominated by the Republican Party for congressional, gubernatorial and local races. ALSO READ | What you need to know about US mid-term polls and why are they so crucial for Joe Biden? He has, however, been blamed for boosting candidates who were unable to appeal to a broad enough electorate, resulting in a lacklustre performance for the Republicans. The results have also signalled exhaustion with the kind of chaos fomented by the Republican former president, raising questions about the viability of his possible 2024 White House run. Laxalt, who lost in Nevada, was a former state attorney-general endorsed by Trump. Biden told reporters the elections showed the Republican Party ""is going to have to decide who they are"". Some Republicans expressed discontent as they faced at least another two years in the minority. ""The old party is dead. Time to bury it. Build something new,"" Sen.

5,Boost For Biden As Democrats Retain Control Of US Senate After Key Polls,"NDTV हिंदी न्यूज़ BUSINESS MOVIES CRICKET TECH FOOD EDUCATION LIFESTYLE HEALTH AUTO Crossword WEB STORIES SWASTH SHOPPING LIVE TV LATEST INDIA Elections OPINION VIDEO CITIES WORLD OFFBEAT TRENDS Photos SOUTH PEOPLE Science WEATHER TV Schedule Trains Boost For Biden As Democrats Retain Control Of US Senate After Key Polls Search ​ Home World News Boost For Biden As Democrats Retain Control Of US Senate After Key Polls Boost For Biden As Democrats Retain Control Of US Senate After Key Polls Republicans had been expecting to ride a mighty ""red wave"" and capture the Senate and the House of Representatives. World News Agence France-Presse Updated: November 13, 2022 11:36 am IST Midterm elections in the US traditionally deliver a rejection of the party in power. (File) Washington: President Joe Biden's Democrats retained control of the US Senate on Saturday, a remarkable midterms election result that defied predictions of a Republican win over both houses of Congress. Midterms traditionally deliver a rejection of the party in power, and with inflation surging and Biden's popularity in the doldrums, Republicans had been expecting to ride a mighty ""red wave"" and capture the Senate and the House of Representatives. But the wave never got much beyond a ripple and on Saturday US networks called the key Senate race in Nevada for Democrat incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto, giving the party the 50 seats it needs for an effective majority. The win clinches Democratic control in the Senate as Vice President Kamala Harris can cast the tie-breaking vote if the upper chamber is evenly split 50-50. ""I feel good and I'm looking forward to the next couple years,"" Biden said of the result, speaking at a meeting of Southeast Asian leaders in Phnom Penh on Sunday. One Senate race remains up in the air -- a runoff in Georgia set for December 6, in which the Democrats could add to their majority. The result in the House of Representatives still hangs in the balance, and while Republicans are slightly favored to take control, it would be with a far smaller majority than they had envisaged going into Tuesday's election. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was quick to ring in his party's win, tweeting the result was a ""vindication"" of Democrats' achievements. Call to 'come together' Speaking minutes after the projections were announced, he said the result showed Americans ""soundly rejected the anti-democratic, authoritarian, nasty and divisive direction the MAGA Republicans wanted to take our country,"" referring to former president Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" movement. Trump was omnipresent on the campaign trail, putting his thumb on key Republican primaries and holding rallies nationwide, during which he repeated his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 race. While more than 100 Republican candidates who challenged the 2020 presidential election results won their races, according to US media projections, some of Trump's hand-picked candidates underperformed and the Republicans' poor showing overall was a damaging political blow. Trump is set to declare his 2024 White House bid on Tuesday -- an announcement he had planned as a triumphant follow-on to an expected crushing election victory by the party he still dominates. Maintaining control of the Senate means Biden and the Democrats will retain key leverage in legislative debates, particularly in domestic and foreign spending policy. Schumer underscored that the Democrats' win would ensure a ""firewall"" against moves by Republicans in Congress to further curtail abortion rights -- a key issue in the midterms -- but also called for members of both parties to ""try to come together."" ""We can disagree on so many issues, that's fair, but let's not have this kind of divisive negativity."" The two parties had been neck-and-neck at 49 seats each after Democrat Mark Kelly was projected to win a tight Senate race in Arizona on Friday evening. The former astronaut beat out challenger Blake Masters, who has not yet conceded defeat and was backed by Trump. Trump's response to the Arizona result was to double down on unfounded claims of ballot rigging, posting on his Truth Social platform that the Democrat's victory was a ""scam"" and the result of ""voter fraud."" The underwhelming outcome for Republicans has prompted a bout of internal finger-pointing, with targets including Trump, the party leaders, and the campaign messaging. US media on Saturday cited a letter circulated by three Republican senators calling for the postponement of party leadership elections currently scheduled for the middle of next week. ""We are all disappointed that a Red Wave failed to materialize, and there are multiple reasons it did not,"" the letter said. ""We need to have serious discussions within our conference as to why and what we can do to improve our chances in 2024,"" it added. After the Senate result was projected, Republican Senator from Missouri Josh Hawley called in a tweet for the party to ""build something new.""

Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada narrowly defeated Adam Laxalt, a Republican former state attorney general, a decisive moment in an extraordinary midterm election in which Democrats defied historical patterns and predictions of major losses. Control of the House has still not been decided, several days after an Election Day that fell short of predictions that Republicans would sweep to power in Washington in a repudiation of President Joe Biden’s leadership. Although Republicans still have an edge in capturing the House, their majority would certainly be small. But with Cortez Masto’s victory in Nevada, which was called by The Associated Press on Saturday night, Democrats have nailed down the 50 seats they need to retain control of the upper chamber, a major feat considering that voters typically punish the president’s party during the midterms. A Dec. 6 runoff in Georgia between Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, will offer only a slight padding of Democrats’ majority or a consolation prize to Republicans. The Democratic victory in Nevada, along with Sen. Mark Kelly’s reelection in Arizona, which was called late Friday, affirmed the thin firewall that the party is trying to fortify in the West. Biden won Arizona by a mere 10,457 votes in 2020; Nevada has been more consistently Democratic in presidential years but erratic in midterms. Cortez Masto, who became the first Latina senator six years ago, had to come from behind to beat Laxalt, who was backed by former President Donald Trump, overtaking him Saturday when mail-in ballots, mainly from Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, were finally tabulated. A Democratic Senate will be invaluable to Biden, even if Republicans narrowly secure control of the House. The president will have two more years to confirm judges to the federal bench and will have more control over personnel in his government with the confirmation of nominees under the guidance of Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader. By never bringing House bills to a vote, Senate Democrats will be able to insulate him from having to veto politically difficult legislation. Senate Democrats will be able to answer political messaging bills passed by the House with political messages of their own, using bipartisan measures like the infrastructure bill and the gun control bill that came out of the current 50-50 Senate in an effort to pressure House Republicans to act. Read | US midterm elections still up in air and Republicans look for whom to blame But in past showdowns, bipartisan solutions secured in the Senate have ultimately been swallowed by the House. That becomes more likely in the case of a divided Congress, with the Senate in Democratic hands. Senate Democrats will also be a voice for the administration when Congress must pass bills to fund the government and raise the statutory borrowing limit. But Republicans, if they win control of the House, will almost certainly try to extract concessions, under the threat of government shutdowns or even a potentially disastrous debt default. Republican leaders in the House have already indicated they will demand to undo a large funding increase for personnel at the IRS, which was included in the Inflation Reduction Act passed this year. They are also planning to press for more money for controls at the U.S. border with Mexico and to complete the border wall started by Trump. For much of the midterm campaigns, Republicans and independent analysts saw GOP control of the House as a foregone conclusion, given Biden’s unpopularity and the headwinds that economic uncertainty and inflation represented for Democratic candidates. But control of the Senate appeared to be a seesaw battle. Those same political headwinds burdened Democratic candidates for the Senate, but weak Republican challengers, many of them endorsed or hand-picked by Trump, gave Democrats a fighting chance in swing states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. In the heated aftermath of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade, which ended constitutional protections for abortion, Democrats thought they could bolster their 50-vote control by two or three seats. Then the pendulum seemed to swing late in the campaigns, and Republicans convinced themselves that the anger over abortion was waning. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the leader of Senate Republicans’ political arm, said in late October that he saw a path to a 55-seat Republican majority, predicting that even Democratic states like Washington and Colorado were in play. In the end, the field proved to be much smaller. Democrats were able to capture just one Republican seat, that of the retiring Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, which was won by the state’s lieutenant governor, John Fetterman. But, so far, Republicans have defeated no Democrats in Senate races. And only one Democratic incumbent, Warnock in Georgia, is left to possible defeat. Deciding Senate control before Georgia’s runoff could affect the Warnock-Walker race. Voters on both sides may have less motivation to turn out with the stakes considerably lower. Democrats hope that will be particularly helpful to Warnock. Walker’s campaign for Senate has been dogged by allegations of domestic violence and exaggerations of his résumé, and by accusations from two former girlfriends that he paid for them to have abortions. The last was especially problematic for a candidate who has been an unwavering opponent of abortion, even in cases of rape or incest. Some Georgia voters appeared to have split their tickets between Warnock and the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, who easily won re-election on Tuesday. Some may have voted for Kemp and left the Senate slots blank. Now, with Kemp not on the ballot and a Senate majority no longer in play, Democrats hope a significant number of Georgia Republicans will stay home on Dec. 6. But the lower stakes could affect Democratic turnout as well, which would deprive Warnock of the claim that his victory carries weight beyond simple Senate control. In truth, however, 51 seats would have practical implications. Instead of evenly divided Senate committees, Democrats would have a numerical majority, which would help them issue subpoenas, research nominations and send legislation to a final vote without the interceding of the Senate Democratic leader.
