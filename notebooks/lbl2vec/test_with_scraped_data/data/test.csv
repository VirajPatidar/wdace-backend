Ad Feedback Video Ad Feedback How common are Ponzi schemes in crypto? Crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried weighs in 03:59 - Source: CNN Business At least $1 billion of customer funds have vanished from collapsed crypto exchange FTX, according to two people familiar with the matter. The exchange’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried secretly transferred $10 billion of customer funds from FTX to Bankman-Fried’s trading company Alameda Research, the people told Reuters.

Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images The week that took down a crypto behemoth A large portion of that total has since disappeared, they said. One source put the missing amount at about $1.7 billion. The other said the gap was between $1 billion and $2 billion. While it is known that FTX moved customer funds to Alameda, the missing funds are reported here for the first time. The financial hole was revealed in records that Bankman-Fried shared with other senior executives last Sunday, according to the two sources. The records provided an up-to-date account of the situation at the time, they said. Both sources held senior FTX positions until this week and said they were briefed on the company’s finances by top staff. Bahamas-based FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday after a rush of customer withdrawals earlier this week. A rescue deal with rival exchange Binance fell through, precipitating crypto’s highest-profile collapse in recent years. In text messages to Reuters, Bankman-Fried said he “disagreed with the characterization” of the $10 billion transfer. “We didn’t secretly transfer,” he said. “We had confusing internal labeling and misread it,” he added, without elaborating. Asked about the missing funds, Bankman-Fried responded: “???” FTX and Alameda did not respond to requests for comment. In a tweet on Friday, Bankman-Fried said he was “piecing together” what had happened at FTX. “I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week,” he wrote. “I will, soon, write up a more complete post on the play by play.” CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried testifies during a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee at Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill December 8, 2021 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong/Getty Images Crypto's white knight lost 94% of his wealth in a single day At the heart of FTX’s problems were losses at Alameda that most FTX executives did not know about, Reuters has previously reported. Customer withdrawals had surged last Sunday after Changpeng Zhao, CEO of giant crypto exchange Binance, said Binance would sell its entire stake in FTX’s digital token, worth at least $580 million, “due to recent revelations.” Four days before, news outlet CoinDesk reported that much of Alameda’s $14.6 billion in assets were held in the token. That Sunday, Bankman-Fried held a meeting with several executives in the Bahamas capital Nassau to calculate how much outside funding he needed to cover FTX’s shortfall, the two people with knowledge of FTX’s finances said. Bankman-Fried confirmed to Reuters that the meeting took place. Bankman-Fried showed several spreadsheets to the heads of the company’s regulatory and legal teams that revealed FTX had moved around $10 billion in client funds from FTX to Alameda, the two people said. The spreadsheets displayed how much money FTX loaned to Alameda and what it was used for, they said. The documents showed that between $1 billion and $2 billion of these funds were not accounted for among Alameda’s assets, the sources said. The spreadsheets did not indicate where this money was moved, and the sources said they don’t know what became of it. In a subsequent examination, FTX legal and finance teams also learned that Bankman-Fried implemented what the two people described as a “backdoor” in FTX’s book-keeping system, which was built using bespoke software. They said the “backdoor” allowed Bankman-Fried to execute commands that could alter the company’s financial records without alerting other people, including external auditors. This set-up meant that the movement of the $10 billion in funds to Alameda did not trigger internal compliance or accounting red flags at FTX, they said.

Photographer: Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images What's next for crypto as FTX collapse triggers 'Lehman moment'? In his text message to Reuters, Bankman-Fried denied implementing a “backdoor.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating FTX.com’s handling of customer funds, as well as its crypto-lending activities, a source with knowledge of the inquiry told Reuters on Wednesday. The Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are also investigating, the source said. FTX’s bankruptcy marked a stunning reversal for Bankman-Fried. The 30-year-old had set up FTX in 2019 and led it to become one of the largest crypto exchanges, accumulating a personal fortune estimated at nearly $17 billion. FTX was valued in January at $32 billion, with investors including SoftBank and BlackRock. The crisis has sent reverberations through the crypto world, with the price of major coins plummeting. And FTX’s collapse is drawing comparisons to earlier major business meltdowns. On Friday, FTX said it had turned over control of the company to John J. Ray III, the restructuring specialist who handled the liquidation of Enron Corp – one of the largest bankruptcies in history.

The assets could be worth more than $400 million, said crypto risk management firm Elliptic. In a tweet early Saturday , FTX general counsel Ryne Miller said the company “initiated precautionary steps” and moved all its digital assets to cold storage, meaning the crypto wallet is no longer connected to the internet. This follows the announcement Friday that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .

Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images The week that took down a crypto behemoth Elliptic said although the theft is unconfirmed, $473 million in crypto assets were apparently stolen from FTX. The process was “expedited” Friday evening “to mitigate damage upon observing unauthorized transactions,” Miller said in a tweet . Miller tweeted late Friday that FTX is “investigating abnormalities” regarding wallet movements “related to consolidation of FTX balances across exchanges.” The facts are still unclear and the company will share more information as soon as possible, he added. The stablecoins and other missing tokens are being quickly converted to ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, on decentralized exchanges, Elliptic said. Elliptic said it is a common technique used by hackers to prevent their funds from being seized. From FTX Official/YouTube Larry David predicted FTX's implosion FTX, until last week one of the most powerful players in the crypto industry, is experiencing a rapid collapse. Its 30-year-old founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has resigned and he has lost his $16 billion fortune in less than a week . In its bankruptcy filing, FTX said it has between $10 billion and $50 billion of estimated liabilities and assets. “I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Bankman-Fried wrote in a Twitter thread Friday . “Hopefully things can find a way to recover.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images Disney plans to freeze hiring and cut jobs, memo shows Nov 12, 2022 Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images At least $1 billion of client funds missing at failed crypto firm FTX, sources say Nov 12, 2022 Ad Feedback CNN Business Videos • Video NBC Dave Chappelle talks Kanye in 'SNL' monologue Nov 13, 2022 • Video Sam Bankman-Fried: 'I'm sorry.

China’s Singles Day sales could top 1 trillion yuan even as the economy cools By Michelle Toh , CNN Business Published 7:15 AM EST, Fri November 11, 2022 Link Copied! Ad Feedback An employee preparing items for delivery for the Singles Day shopping festival at a logistics center in Nanjing, a city in China's eastern Jiangsu province, on Nov. 10, 2022. Stringer/Getty Images Hong Kong CNN Business — China’s Singles Day, the world’s biggest annual shopping event , is known for regularly smashing sales records. This year’s bonanza, which wraps up on Friday and is led by internet titans Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) , will likely be no exception: Analysts expect it to rack up 1 trillion yuan ($140.8 billion) in sales for the first time. Singles Day usually eclipses two of the world’s most popular sales events — Black Friday and Cyber Monday — combined. The festival, also known as “Double 11,” is pegged to China’s unofficial, anti-Valentine’s Day holiday that celebrates people not in romantic relationships. The date — 11.11 — was chosen since written out, it appears as four ones, or singles. But the projected tally would represent just a small uptick — about 5% — on the 952.3 billion yuan ($134.2 billion) notched up last year. That already marked a historic slowdown in growth. Experts have flagged two major factors behind the loss of momentum this year: Competition is up, and consumer confidence is down. The focus, they said, has shifted from generating massive sales to keeping customers happy, particularly in an uncertain environment. Xiaofeng Wang, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester, told CNN Business that she believed Singles Day sales would cross the trillion-yuan mark this week. However, “it’s just impossible to sustain high growth year by year,” she said. “Eventually, [companies] know it’s not a sustainable strategy. That’s why they want to focus on customer experience and customer loyalty.” A ‘gloomier outlook’ Sales growth had already been slowing in recent years. In 2021, the tally for Singles Day rose 13%, “the smallest advance ever,” according to an analysis by Bain & Company . Deborah Weinswig, CEO and founder of Coresight Research, a global advisory and research firm specializing in retail and technology, said it was tough to compare annual growth as the time frame of the event had changed. “When Alibaba initially launched 11.11, the sales period lasted 24 hours,” she noted. Now, the event can stretch out to roughly two weeks or more, depending on each retailer. Weinswig added that vendors were also facing a slew of hurdles this time, tied to the broader economy. “Given China’s weak retail sales this year, declining consumer confidence, unrelenting zero-Covid policy, and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, 11.11 festival growth could slow, as consumers are more cautious about making discretionary purchases,” Weinswig told CNN Business. “Additionally, increasing government regulation of the tech and live-streaming industries could hurt sales growth this year.” E-commerce livestreamer Austin Li Jiaqi attends a public-welfare livestreaming ceremony on September 23, 2021 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China. VCG/Getty Imags China's 'Lipstick King' returns to live-streaming show after mysterious three-month disappearance According to a Bain survey , 34% of customers returning from Singles Day last year said they planned to spend less. “Only 24% said they were planning to spend more — a markedly gloomier outlook than in 2021,” the consultancy noted. Bain experts added that while they, too, could see the festival crossing 1 trillion yuan in sales, “the relatively modest growth needed for that feat is far from guaranteed.” An evolving sector China is undergoing historic economic challenges as it continues to grapple with the impact of a stringent “zero Covid” policy and a faltering global economy. As a result, consumers have been pulling back. Last month, data showed that Chinese retail sales rose 2.5% in September, significantly down from the 5.4% jump recorded in August. This Singles Day, consumers are also affected by “shopping festival fatigue,” due to an increase in online sale events that has led customers to “stock up throughout the year” rather than saving up for large, one-time purchases, according to Kelly Liu, the Shanghai-based head of Bain’s Greater China retail practice.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo/File Photo Aly Song/Reuters Tesla's stock sinks after cutting prices on cars in China Even so, the event will remain important for retailers, Liu added. Wang, the Forrester analyst, said that companies were responding to the spike in competition. Alibaba, for instance, has extended a window for customers to claim a “lowest-price guarantee,” while offering free shipping for returns, she noted. Liu also said that some retailers had “started shipping early to avoid congestion” caused by Covid-related supply chain snags. Singles Day “isn’t going anywhere,” concluded James Yang, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain. “However, in terms of its share of sales, this will likely decline,” he added. “This isn’t necessarily negative; it points towards a market that is maturing with an evolving consumer base.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback More from CNN Business Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images Disney plans to freeze hiring and cut jobs, memo shows Nov 12, 2022 Ting Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images At least $1 billion of client funds missing at failed crypto firm FTX, sources say Nov 12, 2022 Ad Feedback CNN Business Videos • Video NBC Dave Chappelle talks Kanye in 'SNL' monologue Nov 13, 2022 • Video Sam Bankman-Fried: 'I'm sorry.

But it appears that didn’t happen. And investors saw red on their trading screens Wednesday. Stocks ended the day broadly lower, with the Dow plunging more than 645 points, or 2%. Merck (MRK) was the only Dow stock to finish Wednesday higher…and barely so. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 2.1% and 2.5% respectively. One stock in particular that had been surging in anticipation of a sweeping victory for the GOP got hit hard Wednesday. Digital World Acquisition Corp. , a so-called blank check, special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that is hoping to merge with former President Donald Trump’s media company , plunged about 20%. The stock had skyrocketed more than 65% Monday. The market rallied sharply during the past three days following a historic surge for stocks in October. That was due in part to expectations of a convincing victory for Republicans that could give the party control of one or both chambers of Congress — a development that could lead to more investor-friendly gridlock .

There may be disappointment among investors that there won’t be a more robust check on the Biden administration,” said Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist with Stifel. “There will still be gridlock, but there is confusion and a lack of clarity.” Gridlock isn’t great as inflation remains in focus Gardner said the chance of any meaningful new stimulus bills getting passed between now and the 2024 presidential elections are “very slim” -— even if the economy slips into a recession. The best that the market might be able to hope for is that Washington can pass a federal budget and steer clear of more drama about lifting the debt ceiling. “The two parties don’t see it in their best interest to cooperate with the other side,” Gardner said. That may not necessarily be good news for the longer-term though. “Right now you want the decision making in Washington to be quick, in an environment with slowing growth and concerns about a recession rising,” said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro. Still, as the midterm dust settles, investors may now shift their attention back to inflation and the economy. The government will report the October consumer price index figures Thursday morning. Economists expect that CPI rose 8% in the past 12 months. That’s still historically high, but it would be a slight pullback from the 8.2% increase in September. Investors are hoping that if inflation continues to cool, the Fed may be able to finally slow the pace of interest rate hikes following four consecutive increases of three-quarters of a point. With that in mind, investors probably should focus more on the economy and corporate earnings — especially since history shows that stocks have tended to go up following elections , regardless of which party is in power. “Elections are a very important part of the puzzle, but it’s only one of many factors,” said Kevin Green, senior researcher at Dimensional Fund Advisors. “Markets have performed remarkably similar during periods of a Republican or Democratic controlled Congress.” Still, there are some concerns about weaker profits as the economy slows. Shares of Disney (DIS) , gaming company Roblox and electric vehicle startup Lucid all plunged between 13% and 21% following weak results. Facebook owner Meta Platforms also confirmed a major round of layoffs …but the stock rallied more than 5% on the news.
