Researchers and enthusiasts alike, work on numerous aspects of the field to make amazing things happen. One of many such areas is the domain of Computer Vision. The agenda for this field is to enable machines to view the world as humans do, perceive it in a similar manner, and even use the knowledge for a multitude of tasks such as Image & Video recognition, Image Analysis & Classification, Media Recreation, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Processing, etc. The advancements in Computer Vision with Deep Learning have been constructed and perfected with time, primarily over one particular algorithm — a Convolutional Neural Network .

Introduction A CNN sequence to classify handwritten digits A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics. The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area. Why ConvNets over Feed-Forward Neural Nets? Flattening of a 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector An image is nothing but a matrix of pixel values, right? So why not just flatten the image (e.g. 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector) and feed it to a Multi-Level Perceptron for classification purposes? Uh.. not really. In cases of extremely basic binary images, the method might show an average precision score while performing prediction of classes but would have little to no accuracy when it comes to complex images having pixel dependencies throughout. A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters involved and the reusability of weights. In other words, the network can be trained to understand the sophistication of the image better. Input Image 4x4x3 RGB Image In the figure, we have an RGB image that has been separated by its three color planes — Red, Green, and Blue. There are a number of such color spaces in which images exist — Grayscale, RGB, HSV, CMYK, etc. You can imagine how computationally intensive things would get once the images reach dimensions, say 8K (7680×4320). The role of ConvNet is to reduce the images into a form that is easier to process, without losing features that are critical for getting a good prediction. This is important when we are to design an architecture that is not only good at learning features but also scalable to massive datasets. Convolution Layer — The Kernel Convoluting a 5x5x1 image with a 3x3x1 kernel to get a 3x3x1 convolved feature Image Dimensions = 5 (Height) x 5 (Breadth) x 1 (Number of channels, eg. RGB) In the above demonstration, the green section resembles our 5x5x1 input image, I . The element involved in the convolution operation in the first part of a Convolutional Layer is called the Kernel/Filter, K , represented in color yellow. We have selected K as a 3x3x1 matrix. Kernel/Filter, K = 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 The Kernel shifts 9 times because of Stride Length = 1 (Non-Strided) , every time performing an elementwise multiplication operation ( Hadamard Product ) between K and the portion P of the image over which the kernel is hovering. Movement of the Kernel The filter moves to the right with a certain Stride Value till it parses the complete width. Moving on, it hops down to the beginning (left) of the image with the same Stride Value and repeats the process until the entire image is traversed. Convolution operation on a MxNx3 image matrix with a 3x3x3 Kernel In the case of images with multiple channels (e.g. RGB), the Kernel has the same depth as that of the input image. Matrix Multiplication is performed between Kn and In stack ([K1, I1]; [K2, I2]; [K3, I3]) and all the results are summed with the bias to give us a squashed one-depth channel Convoluted Feature Output. Convolution Operation with Stride Length = 2 The objective of the Convolution Operation is to extract the high-level features such as edges, from the input image. ConvNets need not be limited to only one Convolutional Layer. Conventionally, the first ConvLayer is responsible for capturing the Low-Level features such as edges, color, gradient orientation, etc. With added layers, the architecture adapts to the High-Level features as well, giving us a network that has a wholesome understanding of images in the dataset, similar to how we would. There are two types of results to the operation — one in which the convolved feature is reduced in dimensionality as compared to the input, and the other in which the dimensionality is either increased or remains the same. This is done by applying Valid Padding in the case of the former, or Same Padding in the case of the latter. SAME padding: 5x5x1 image is padded with 0s to create a 6x6x1 image When we augment the 5x5x1 image into a 6x6x1 image and then apply the 3x3x1 kernel over it, we find that the convolved matrix turns out to be of dimensions 5x5x1. Hence the name — Same Padding . On the other hand, if we perform the same operation without padding, we are presented with a matrix that has dimensions of the Kernel (3x3x1) itself — Valid Padding . The following repository houses many such GIFs which would help you get a better understanding of how Padding and Stride Length work together to achieve results relevant to our needs. vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic A technical report on convolution arithmetic in the context of deep learning - vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic github.com Pooling Layer 3x3 pooling over 5x5 convolved feature Similar to the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it is useful for extracting dominant features which are rotational and positional invariant, thus maintaining the process of effectively training the model. There are two types of Pooling: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Max Pooling returns the maximum value from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. On the other hand, Average Pooling returns the average of all the values from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. Max Pooling also performs as a Noise Suppressant . It discards the noisy activations altogether and also performs de-noising along with dimensionality reduction. On the other hand, Average Pooling simply performs dimensionality reduction as a noise-suppressing mechanism. Hence, we can say that Max Pooling performs a lot better than Average Pooling . Types of Pooling The Convolutional Layer and the Pooling Layer, together form the i-th layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Depending on the complexities in the images, the number of such layers may be increased for capturing low-level details even further, but at the cost of more computational power. After going through the above process, we have successfully enabled the model to understand the features. Moving on, we are going to flatten the final output and feed it to a regular Neural Network for classification purposes. Classification — Fully Connected Layer (FC Layer) Adding a Fully-Connected layer is a (usually) cheap way of learning non-linear combinations of the high-level features as represented by the output of the convolutional layer. The Fully-Connected layer is learning a possibly non-linear function in that space. Now that we have converted our input image into a suitable form for our Multi-Level Perceptron, we shall flatten the image into a column vector. The flattened output is fed to a feed-forward neural network and backpropagation is applied to every iteration of training. Over a series of epochs, the model is able to distinguish between dominating and certain low-level features in images and classify them using the Softmax Classification technique. There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms which power and shall power AI as a whole in the foreseeable future. Some of them have been listed below: LeNet AlexNet VGGNet GoogLeNet ResNet ZFNet GitHub Notebook — Recognising Hand Written Digits using MNIST Dataset with TensorFlow ss-is-master-chief/MNIST-Digit.Recognizer-CNNs Implementation of CNN to recognize hand written digits (MNIST) running for 10 epochs.

3,What are Convolutional Neural Networks?  | IBM,"Skip to content IBM Cloud Learn Hub What are Convolutional Neural Networks? Convolutional Neural Networks By: IBM Cloud Education 20 October 2020 What are convolutional neural networks? How do convolutional neural networks work? Types of convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks and IBM Jump to ... What are convolutional neural networks? How do convolutional neural networks work? Types of convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks and IBM Convolutional Neural Networks Learn how convolutional neural networks use three-dimensional data to for image classification and object recognition tasks. What are convolutional neural networks? To reiterate from the Neural Networks Learn Hub article, neural networks are a subset of machine learning, and they are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network. While we primarily focused on feedforward networks in that article, there are various types of neural nets, which are used for different use cases and data types. For example, recurrent neural networks are commonly used for natural language processing and speech recognition whereas convolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are more often utilized for classification and computer vision tasks. Prior to CNNs, manual, time-consuming feature extraction methods were used to identify objects in images. However, convolutional neural networks now provide a more scalable approach to image classification and object recognition tasks, leveraging principles from linear algebra, specifically matrix multiplication, to identify patterns within an image. That said, they can be computationally demanding, requiring graphical processing units (GPUs) to train models. How do convolutional neural networks work? Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are: Convolutional layer Pooling layer Fully-connected (FC) layer The convolutional layer is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or pooling layers, the fully-connected layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object. Convolutional Layer The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are input data, a filter, and a feature map. Let’s assume that the input will be a color image, which is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D. This means that the input will have three dimensions—a height, width, and depth—which correspond to RGB in an image. We also have a feature detector, also known as a kernel or a filter, which will move across the receptive fields of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a convolution. The feature detector is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. While they can vary in size, the filter size is typically a 3x3 matrix; this also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the filter. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the filter shifts by a stride, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image. The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map, or a convolved feature. As you can see in the image above, each output value in the feature map does not have to connect to each pixel value in the input image. It only needs to connect to the receptive field, where the filter is being applied. Since the output array does not need to map directly to each input value, convolutional (and pooling) layers are commonly referred to as “partially connected” layers. However, this characteristic can also be described as local connectivity. Note that the weights in the feature detector remain fixed as it moves across the image, which is also known as parameter sharing. Some parameters, like the weight values, adjust during training through the process of backpropagation and gradient descent. However, there are three hyperparameters which affect the volume size of the output that need to be set before the training of the neural network begins. These include: 1. The number of filters affects the depth of the output. For example, three distinct filters would yield three different feature maps, creating a depth of three. 2. Stride is the distance, or number of pixels, that the kernel moves over the input matrix. While stride values of two or greater is rare, a larger stride yields a smaller output. 3. Zero-padding is usually used when the filters do not fit the input image. This sets all elements that fall outside of the input matrix to zero, producing a larger or equally sized output. There are three types of padding: Valid padding: This is also known as no padding. In this case, the last convolution is dropped if dimensions do not align. Same padding: This padding ensures that the output layer has the same size as the input layer Full padding: This type of padding increases the size of the output by adding zeros to the border of the input. After each convolution operation, a CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model. As we mentioned earlier, another convolution layer can follow the initial convolution layer. When this happens, the structure of the CNN can become hierarchical as the later layers can see the pixels within the receptive fields of prior layers.  As an example, let’s assume that we’re trying to determine if an image contains a bicycle. You can think of the bicycle as a sum of parts. It is comprised of a frame, handlebars, wheels, pedals, et cetera. Each individual part of the bicycle makes up a lower-level pattern in the neural net, and the combination of its parts represents a higher-level pattern, creating a feature hierarchy within the CNN. Ultimately, the convolutional layer converts the image into numerical values, allowing the neural network to interpret and extract relevant patterns. Pooling Layer Pooling layers, also known as downsampling, conducts dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of parameters in the input. Similar to the convolutional layer, the pooling operation sweeps a filter across the entire input, but the difference is that this filter does not have any weights. Instead, the kernel applies an aggregation function to the values within the receptive field, populating the output array. There are two main types of pooling: Max pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it selects the pixel with the maximum value to send to the output array. As an aside, this approach tends to be used more often compared to average pooling. Average pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it calculates the average value within the receptive field to send to the output array. While a lot of information is lost in the pooling layer, it also has a number of benefits to the CNN. They help to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and limit risk of overfitting. Fully-Connected Layer The name of the full-connected layer aptly describes itself. As mentioned earlier, the pixel values of the input image are not directly connected to the output layer in partially connected layers. However, in the fully-connected layer, each node in the output layer connects directly to a node in the previous layer. This layer performs the task of classification based on the features extracted through the previous layers and their different filters. While convolutional and pooling layers tend to use ReLu functions, FC layers usually leverage a softmax activation function to classify inputs appropriately, producing a probability from 0 to 1. Types of convolutional neural networks Kunihiko Fukushima and Yann LeCun laid the foundation of research around convolutional neural networks in their work in 1980 (PDF, 1.1 MB) (link resides outside IBM) and 1989 (PDF, 5.5 MB)(link resides outside of IBM), respectively. More famously, Yann LeCun successfully applied backpropagation to train neural networks to identify and recognize patterns within a series of handwritten zip codes. He would continue his research with his team throughout the 1990s, culminating with “LeNet-5”, (PDF, 933 KB) (link resides outside IBM), which applied the same principles of prior research to document recognition. Since then, a number of variant CNN architectures have emerged with the introduction of new datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, and competitions, like ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Some of these other architectures include: AlexNet (PDF, 1.4 MB) (link resides outside IBM) VGGNet (PDF, 195 KB) (link resides outside IBM) GoogLeNet (PDF, 1.3 MB) (link resides outside IBM) ResNet (PDF, 800 KB) (link resides outside IBM) ZFNet However, LeNet-5 is known as the classic CNN architecture. Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks power image recognition and computer vision tasks. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs, and based on those inputs, it can take action. This ability to provide recommendations distinguishes it from image recognition tasks. Some common applications of this computer vision today can be seen in: Marketing: Social media platforms provide suggestions on who might be in photograph that has been posted on a profile, making it easier to tag friends in photo albums. Healthcare: Computer vision has been incorporated into radiology technology, enabling doctors to better identify cancerous tumors in healthy anatomy. Retail: Visual search has been incorporated into some e-commerce platforms, allowing brands to recommend items that would complement an existing wardrobe. Automotive : While the age of driverless cars hasn’t quite emerged, the underlying technology has started to make its way into automobiles, improving driver and passenger safety through features like lane line detection. Convolutional neural networks and IBM For decades now, IBM has been a pioneer in the development of AI technologies and neural networks, highlighted by the development and evolution of IBM Watson. Watson is now a trusted solution for enterprises looking to apply advanced visual recognition and deep learning techniques to their systems using a proven tiered approach to AI adoption and implementation.

This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning. It can be hard to get your hands around what LSTMs are, and how terms like bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence relate to the field. In this post, you will get insight into LSTMs using the words of research scientists that developed the methods and applied them to new and important problems. There are few that are better at clearly and precisely articulating both the promise of LSTMs and how they work than the experts that developed them. We will explore key questions in the field of LSTMs using quotes from the experts, and if you’re interested, you will be able to dive into the original papers from which the quotes were taken. Kick-start your project with my new book Long Short-Term Memory Networks With Python , including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Long Short-Term Memory Networks by the Experts Photo by Oran Viriyincy , some rights reserved. The Promise of Recurrent Neural Networks Recurrent neural networks are different from traditional feed-forward neural networks. This difference in the addition of complexity comes with the promise of new behaviors that the traditional methods cannot achieve. Recurrent networks … have an internal state that can represent context information. … [they] keep information about past inputs for an amount of time that is not fixed a priori, but rather depends on its weights and on the input data. … A recurrent network whose inputs are not fixed but rather constitute an input sequence can be used to transform an input sequence into an output sequence while taking into account contextual information in a flexible way. — Yoshua Bengio, et al., Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent is Difficult , 1994. The paper defines 3 basic requirements of a recurrent neural network: That the system be able to store information for an arbitrary duration. That the system be resistant to noise (i.e. fluctuations of the inputs that are random or irrelevant to predicting a correct output). That the system parameters be trainable (in reasonable time). The paper also describes the “minimal task” for demonstrating recurrent neural networks. Context is key. Recurrent neural networks must use context when making predictions, but to this extent, the context required must also be learned. … recurrent neural networks contain cycles that feed the network activations from a previous time step as inputs to the network to influence predictions at the current time step. These activations are stored in the internal states of the network which can in principle hold long-term temporal contextual information. This mechanism allows RNNs to exploit a dynamically changing contextual window over the input sequence history — Hassim Sak, et al., Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Large Scale Acoustic Modeling , 2014 Need help with LSTMs for Sequence Prediction?

LSTMs Deliver on the Promise The success of LSTMs is in their claim to be one of the first implements to overcome the technical problems and deliver on the promise of recurrent neural networks. Hence standard RNNs fail to learn in the presence of time lags greater than 5 – 10 discrete time steps between relevant input events and target signals. The vanishing error problem casts doubt on whether standard RNNs can indeed exhibit significant practical advantages over time window-based feedforward networks. A recent model, “Long Short-Term Memory” (LSTM), is not affected by this problem. LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error flow through “constant error carrousels” (CECs) within special units, called cells — Felix A. Gers, et al., Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM , 2000 The two technical problems overcome by LSTMs are vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, both related to how the network is trained. Unfortunately, the range of contextual information that standard RNNs can access is in practice quite limited. The problem is that the influence of a given input on the hidden layer, and therefore on the network output, either decays or blows up exponentially as it cycles around the network’s recurrent connections. This shortcoming … referred to in the literature as the vanishing gradient problem … Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. — Alex Graves, et al., A Novel Connectionist System for Unconstrained Handwriting Recognition , 2009 The key to the LSTM solution to the technical problems was the specific internal structure of the units used in the model. … governed by its ability to deal with vanishing and exploding gradients, the most common challenge in designing and training RNNs. To address this challenge, a particular form of recurrent nets, called LSTM, was introduced and applied with great success to translation and sequence generation. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. How do LSTMs Work? Rather than go into the equations that govern how LSTMs are fit, analogy is a useful tool to quickly get a handle on how they work. We use networks with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer… The (fully) self-connected hidden layer contains memory cells and corresponding gate units… … Each memory cell’s internal architecture guarantees constant error flow within its constant error carrousel CEC… This represents the basis for bridging very long time lags. Two gate units learn to open and close access to error flow within each memory cell’s CEC. The multiplicative input gate affords protection of the CEC from perturbation by irrelevant inputs. Likewise, the multiplicative output gate protects other units from perturbation by currently irrelevant memory contents. — Sepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber, Long Short-Term Memory , 1997. Multiple analogies can help to give purchase on what differentiates LSTMs from traditional neural networks comprised of simple neurons. The Long Short Term Memory architecture was motivated by an analysis of error flow in existing RNNs which found that long time lags were inaccessible to existing architectures, because backpropagated error either blows up or decays exponentially. An LSTM layer consists of a set of recurrently connected blocks, known as memory blocks. These blocks can be thought of as a differentiable version of the memory chips in a digital computer. Each one contains one or more recurrently connected memory cells and three multiplicative units – the input, output and forget gates – that provide continuous analogues of write, read and reset operations for the cells. … The net can only interact with the cells via the gates. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. It is interesting to note, that even after more than 20 years, the simple (or vanilla) LSTM may still be the best place to start when applying the technique. The most commonly used LSTM architecture (vanilla LSTM) performs reasonably well on various datasets… Learning rate and network size are the most crucial tunable LSTM hyperparameters … … This implies that the hyperparameters can be tuned independently. In particular, the learning rate can be calibrated first using a fairly small network, thus saving a lot of experimentation time. — Klaus Greff, et al., LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey , 2015 What are LSTM Applications? It is important to get a handle on exactly what type of sequence learning problems that LSTMs are suitable to address. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can solve numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). … … LSTM holds promise for any sequential processing task in which we suspect that a hierarchical decomposition may exist, but do not know in advance what this decomposition is. — Felix A. Gers, et al., Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM , 2000 The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is neural sequence model that achieves state of the art performance on important tasks that include language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation. — Wojciech Zaremba, Recurrent Neural Network Regularization , 2014. Since LSTMs are effective at capturing long-term temporal dependencies without suffering from the optimization hurdles that plague simple recurrent networks (SRNs), they have been used to advance the state of the art for many difficult problems. This includes handwriting recognition and generation, language modeling and translation, acoustic modeling of speech, speech synthesis, protein secondary structure prediction, analysis of audio, and video data among others. — Klaus Greff, et al., LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey , 2015 What are Bidirectional LSTMs? A commonly mentioned improvement upon LSTMs are bidirectional LSTMs. The basic idea of bidirectional recurrent neural nets is to present each training sequence forwards and backwards to two separate recurrent nets, both of which are connected to the same output layer. … This means that for every point in a given sequence, the BRNN has complete, sequential information about all points before and after it. Also, because the net is free to use as much or as little of this context as necessary, there is no need to find a (task-dependent) time-window or target delay size. … for temporal problems like speech recognition, relying on knowledge of the future seems at first sight to violate causality … How can we base our understanding of what we’ve heard on something that hasn’t been said yet? However, human listeners do exactly that. Sounds, words, and even whole sentences that at first mean nothing are found to make sense in the light of future context. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. One shortcoming of conventional RNNs is that they are only able to make use of previous context. … Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) do this by processing the data in both directions with two separate hidden layers, which are then fed forwards to the same output layer. … Combining BRNNs with LSTM gives bidirectional LSTM, which can access long-range context in both input directions — Alex Graves, et al., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks , 2013 Unlike conventional RNNs, bidirectional RNNs utilize both the previous and future context, by processing the data from two directions with two separate hidden layers. One layer processes the input sequence in the forward direction, while the other processes the input in the reverse direction. The output of current time step is then generated by combining both layers’ hidden vector… — Di Wang and Eric Nyberg, A Long Short-Term Memory Model for Answer Sentence Selection in Question Answering , 2015 What are seq2seq LSTMs or RNN Encoder-Decoders? The sequence-to-sequence LSTM, also called encoder-decoder LSTMs, are an application of LSTMs that are receiving a lot of attention given their impressive capability. … a straightforward application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can solve general sequence to sequence problems. … The idea is to use one LSTM to read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, to obtain large fixed-dimensional vector representation, and then to use another LSTM to extract the output sequence from that vector. The second LSTM is essentially a recurrent neural network language model except that it is conditioned on the input sequence. The LSTM’s ability to successfully learn on data with long range temporal dependencies makes it a natural choice for this application due to the considerable time lag between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. We were able to do well on long sentences because we reversed the order of words in the source sentence but not the target sentences in the training and test set. By doing so, we introduced many short term dependencies that made the optimization problem much simpler. … The simple trick of reversing the words in the source sentence is one of the key technical contributions of this work — Ilya Sutskever, et al., Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks , 2014 An “encoder” RNN reads the source sentence and transforms it into a rich fixed-length vector representation, which in turn in used as the initial hidden state of a “decoder” RNN that generates the target sentence. Here, we propose to follow this elegant recipe, replacing the encoder RNN by a deep convolution neural network (CNN). … it is natural to use a CNN as an image “encoder”, by first pre-training it for an image classification task and using the last hidden layer as an input to the RNN decoder that generates sentences. — Oriol Vinyals, et al., Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator , 2014 … an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target sequence. — Kyunghyun Cho, et al., Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation , 2014 Summary In this post, you received a gentle introduction to LSTMs in the words of the research scientists that developed and applied the techniques.

Reply Jason Brownlee June 2, 2017 at 11:49 am # Yes, it is better tot use past observations as time steps when inputting to the model. Reply Dhineshkumar July 8, 2017 at 12:06 am # Hi Jason, Reply Jason Brownlee July 9, 2017 at 10:47 am # Yes, no fixed length input or output sequences. Reply Claudio July 11, 2017 at 8:33 am # Hello, good explanation and intoduction. model.add(LSTM(4)) model.add(Dense(1)) How many neurons I have on my input layers? I think the first line of code refer to the hidden layers, how things get in? Reply Jason Brownlee July 11, 2017 at 10:39 am # These are not input layers, but are instead hidden layers. You must specify the size of the expected input as an argument “input_shape=(xx,xx)” on the first hidden layer. The input_shape specifies a tuple that specifies the number of time steps and features. A feature is the number of observations taken at each time step. See this post for more: https://machinelearningmastery.com/5-step-life-cycle-long-short-term-memory-models-keras/ Does that help? Reply abc September 30, 2017 at 1:21 am # waste of my time. Reply Jason Brownlee September 30, 2017 at 7:43 am # Sorry to hear that. Reply Long October 23, 2017 at 9:30 am # Hi Jason, layers.LSTM(units=4, activation=’tanh’, dropout=0.1)(lstm_input) what does the units here mean? I put the units here equals neurons number of hidden layer. Am I right? But if the input sequence is smaller than the number of the units here (i.e. blocks/neuron), does ir mean that some neurons in the lstm layer have not input series, just pass states to the next neurons? Thanks a lot. Reply Jason Brownlee October 23, 2017 at 4:11 pm # Yes, you are correct. No, one unit can have many inputs. Further, the RNN only takes one time step as input at a time. Reply Long October 23, 2017 at 6:21 pm # Hi Jason, I still confused about this topic. Let me say: 28 steps series are input the LSTM layer, while there are 128 neuron. Does it mean 100 neurons have not input at this situation, just pass previous states to the next neurons? Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43034960/many-to-one-and-many-to-many-lstm-examples-in-keras , the green rectangles represent the LSTM blocks/neuron in keras, which is 128. The pink rectangles represent the input series, which is 28. And the blue rectangles represent the output series. Thank you very much. Jason Brownlee October 24, 2017 at 5:28 am # No, the number of time steps and number of units are not related. Long October 24, 2017 at 9:39 am # Hi Jason, Thanks for your answer. When we use layers.LSTM(units=128, activation=’tanh’, dropout=0.1)(lstm_input) does we mean there are 128 units in A (depicted in http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ )? If yes, what is the structure of such A like? Reply Jason Brownlee October 24, 2017 at 3:58 pm # 128 means 128 memory cells or neurons or what have you. I cannot speak to the pictures on another site. Perhaps contact their author? Reply Long October 25, 2017 at 1:06 pm # Thanks Jason. I just wanted to know the structure of the LSTM layer with 128 units, and the input and output. Reply Jason Brownlee October 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm # Generally, in Keras the shape of the input is defined by the output of the prior layer. The shape of the input to the network is specified on the visible layer or as an argument on the first hidden layer.

From the RNN unfolding description, I found that each RNN/LSTM cell take one time step at time. This part confuse me a lot. Can you please clarify me? Reply Jason Brownlee October 16, 2018 at 6:33 am # No, the number of units in the first hidden layer is unrelated to the number of times steps in the input data. Reply Abdullah Al Mamun May 4, 2019 at 2:18 pm # Hello sir, What are the differences between time steps and time lags? I’m confused about these two terms. Also, what are the methods of finding optimal no of time lags in LSTM network? Reply Jason Brownlee May 5, 2019 at 6:23 am # A time step could be input or output, a lag is a time step from the past relative to the current observation or prediction. Trial and error is best we can do, perhaps informed by ACF/PACF plots.

Reply Rahul Krishnan February 21, 2020 at 6:46 pm # I have a question regarding the mapping of input to the hidden nodes in a seq2seq (encoder-decoder) model you talked about. Reading about it further I understand that the hidden nodes count are usually matched to the dimension of the vectorized input (read as a word is represented by it’s embedding), but this is usually not the case. So given the latter, if hidden node count is lesser than the dimension of the input, what is the mapping between the two. (is it maybe fully connected?) Understanding this mapping can help me better understand how the LSTM learns as a whole. Reply Jason Brownlee February 22, 2020 at 6:22 am # The encoding of the entire input sequence is used as a context in generating each step of the output sequence, regardless of how long it is.

Or consider the stride fixed at 1, e.g. one time step. You can achieve this effect using a CNN-LSTM. Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 3, 2020 at 5:00 am # Hi Jason. This is a great article. I follow your website to learn different Machine Learning Concepts and techniques. I am currently working on Binary Classification problem where data contains logs recorded at any point of time. each log record has multiple features with label as Pass/Fail. I used LSTM for such sequence classification. I want to understand how LSTM works internally for sequence classification problem. Could you please suggest some references for that? Thank You Reply Jason Brownlee September 3, 2020 at 6:10 am # This will help as a first step: https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/how-is-data-processed-by-an-lstm Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 3, 2020 at 7:47 am # Thank you Jason for quick reply. Here is what I understood: each node in the layer will get one time step of input sequence at a time,process it and give one output label(for Sequence Classification). Output of last time step from end of sequence will be used further. I am still curious how output vector from all nodes will be used later in the processing. Could you please elaborate more on it? Reply Jason Brownlee September 3, 2020 at 1:41 pm # The entire vector of outputs from layer is passed to the next layer for consideration, if return_sequences is true, otherwise the output from the last time step is passed to the next layer. This applies for each node in the layer. Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 5, 2020 at 7:57 am # Thank You Jason. I understood. As I mentioned earlier, I am currently working on Binary classification problem. I have one more question. Dataset contains storage drives(unique id) with multiple heads(one drive will have multiple records/1:many), each head will have multiple records of events with different time(unit hour). We can say it is time series data. Here Label for each record is PASS/FAIL head. Below is the snapshot of dataset. drive head time feature1 label 1. 0. t1 x PASS 1. 0. t2. y PASS 1. 1. t1. z. PASS 1. 2. t1. p. PASS 1. 2. t2. w. PASS 2. 0. t1. x. FAIL 2. 0. t2. y. FAIL Our goal is to predict drive will fail within next X hour. If we can predict pass/fail head then we can combine all head prediction and maximum prediction will be prediction of drive. We first converted this tabular data into 3D sequences for each unique drive, used LSTM as LSTM requires input in shape of (samples, time steps, features) My question is while preparing sequence for LSTM, Should it be for each drive or for each head? Also, once we get head level prediction, is there any other way to get drive level prediction? Thank You. Jason Brownlee September 5, 2020 at 8:09 am # Yes, I think each drive would be one sample to train the model. Yes, you can make a prediction by calling model.predict() this will help: https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-predictions-long-short-term-memory-models-keras/ Jaiminee Kataria September 17, 2020 at 3:49 am # Thank You Jason. This article helped me in the process. As I started adding more data, I see that it is severe imbalance between major(negative) and minor(positive) class. I am aware that SMOTE and it’s variation are best way to handle imbalance data but I am not able to figure out how I can use SMOTE with LSTM time series binary classification. Could you please suggest some reference or other technique I should use with LSTM for imbalance data? Thank You. Reply Jason Brownlee September 17, 2020 at 6:51 am # SMOTE is not appropriate for sequence data. Perhaps try designing your own sequence data augmentation generator? Reply Dhruv November 2, 2020 at 6:37 pm # Hello Jason, I had a question…. What information does the hidden state in an LSTM carry?

Reply Daniel February 5, 2021 at 1:39 am # Hi Jason, thanks for the detailed explanations! One short question: “A recurrent network whose inputs are not fixed but rather constitute an input sequence can be used to transform an input sequence into an output sequence while taking into account contextual information in a flexible way.” Why is a vanilla neural network restricted to a fixed input size, while a RNN is not? Could you elaborate on this with an example? Thanks a lot in advance! Reply Jason Brownlee February 5, 2021 at 5:43 am # You’re welcome. MLPs cannot take a sequence, instead we have to take each time step of the sequences as a “feature” with no time dimension. Reply Prakash M Nadkarni July 6, 2021 at 1:19 pm # Good article.

3,A Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks — the ELI5 way | by Sumit Saha | Towards Data Science,"Open in app Home Notifications Lists Stories Write Published in Towards Data Science Sumit Saha Follow Dec 15, 2018 · 7 min read Save A Comprehensive Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks — the ELI5 way Artificial Intelligence has been witnessing monumental growth in bridging the gap between the capabilities of humans and machines. Researchers and enthusiasts alike, work on numerous aspects of the field to make amazing things happen. One of many such areas is the domain of Computer Vision. The agenda for this field is to enable machines to view the world as humans do, perceive it in a similar manner, and even use the knowledge for a multitude of tasks such as Image & Video recognition, Image Analysis & Classification, Media Recreation, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Processing, etc. The advancements in Computer Vision with Deep Learning have been constructed and perfected with time, primarily over one particular algorithm — a Convolutional Neural Network . Ready to try out your own convolutional neural nets? Check out Saturn Cloud for free compute (including free GPUs). Introduction A CNN sequence to classify handwritten digits A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image, and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics. The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area. Why ConvNets over Feed-Forward Neural Nets? Flattening of a 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector An image is nothing but a matrix of pixel values, right? So why not just flatten the image (e.g. 3x3 image matrix into a 9x1 vector) and feed it to a Multi-Level Perceptron for classification purposes? Uh.. not really. In cases of extremely basic binary images, the method might show an average precision score while performing prediction of classes but would have little to no accuracy when it comes to complex images having pixel dependencies throughout. A ConvNet is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. The architecture performs a better fitting to the image dataset due to the reduction in the number of parameters involved and the reusability of weights. In other words, the network can be trained to understand the sophistication of the image better. Input Image 4x4x3 RGB Image In the figure, we have an RGB image that has been separated by its three color planes — Red, Green, and Blue. There are a number of such color spaces in which images exist — Grayscale, RGB, HSV, CMYK, etc. You can imagine how computationally intensive things would get once the images reach dimensions, say 8K (7680×4320). The role of ConvNet is to reduce the images into a form that is easier to process, without losing features that are critical for getting a good prediction. This is important when we are to design an architecture that is not only good at learning features but also scalable to massive datasets. Convolution Layer — The Kernel Convoluting a 5x5x1 image with a 3x3x1 kernel to get a 3x3x1 convolved feature Image Dimensions = 5 (Height) x 5 (Breadth) x 1 (Number of channels, eg. RGB) In the above demonstration, the green section resembles our 5x5x1 input image, I . The element involved in the convolution operation in the first part of a Convolutional Layer is called the Kernel/Filter, K , represented in color yellow. We have selected K as a 3x3x1 matrix. Kernel/Filter, K = 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 The Kernel shifts 9 times because of Stride Length = 1 (Non-Strided) , every time performing an elementwise multiplication operation ( Hadamard Product ) between K and the portion P of the image over which the kernel is hovering. Movement of the Kernel The filter moves to the right with a certain Stride Value till it parses the complete width. Moving on, it hops down to the beginning (left) of the image with the same Stride Value and repeats the process until the entire image is traversed. Convolution operation on a MxNx3 image matrix with a 3x3x3 Kernel In the case of images with multiple channels (e.g. RGB), the Kernel has the same depth as that of the input image. Matrix Multiplication is performed between Kn and In stack ([K1, I1]; [K2, I2]; [K3, I3]) and all the results are summed with the bias to give us a squashed one-depth channel Convoluted Feature Output. Convolution Operation with Stride Length = 2 The objective of the Convolution Operation is to extract the high-level features such as edges, from the input image. ConvNets need not be limited to only one Convolutional Layer. Conventionally, the first ConvLayer is responsible for capturing the Low-Level features such as edges, color, gradient orientation, etc. With added layers, the architecture adapts to the High-Level features as well, giving us a network that has a wholesome understanding of images in the dataset, similar to how we would. There are two types of results to the operation — one in which the convolved feature is reduced in dimensionality as compared to the input, and the other in which the dimensionality is either increased or remains the same. This is done by applying Valid Padding in the case of the former, or Same Padding in the case of the latter. SAME padding: 5x5x1 image is padded with 0s to create a 6x6x1 image When we augment the 5x5x1 image into a 6x6x1 image and then apply the 3x3x1 kernel over it, we find that the convolved matrix turns out to be of dimensions 5x5x1. Hence the name — Same Padding . On the other hand, if we perform the same operation without padding, we are presented with a matrix that has dimensions of the Kernel (3x3x1) itself — Valid Padding . The following repository houses many such GIFs which would help you get a better understanding of how Padding and Stride Length work together to achieve results relevant to our needs. vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic A technical report on convolution arithmetic in the context of deep learning - vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic github.com Pooling Layer 3x3 pooling over 5x5 convolved feature Similar to the Convolutional Layer, the Pooling layer is responsible for reducing the spatial size of the Convolved Feature. This is to decrease the computational power required to process the data through dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, it is useful for extracting dominant features which are rotational and positional invariant, thus maintaining the process of effectively training the model. There are two types of Pooling: Max Pooling and Average Pooling. Max Pooling returns the maximum value from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. On the other hand, Average Pooling returns the average of all the values from the portion of the image covered by the Kernel. Max Pooling also performs as a Noise Suppressant . It discards the noisy activations altogether and also performs de-noising along with dimensionality reduction. On the other hand, Average Pooling simply performs dimensionality reduction as a noise-suppressing mechanism. Hence, we can say that Max Pooling performs a lot better than Average Pooling . Types of Pooling The Convolutional Layer and the Pooling Layer, together form the i-th layer of a Convolutional Neural Network. Depending on the complexities in the images, the number of such layers may be increased for capturing low-level details even further, but at the cost of more computational power. After going through the above process, we have successfully enabled the model to understand the features. Moving on, we are going to flatten the final output and feed it to a regular Neural Network for classification purposes. Classification — Fully Connected Layer (FC Layer) Adding a Fully-Connected layer is a (usually) cheap way of learning non-linear combinations of the high-level features as represented by the output of the convolutional layer. The Fully-Connected layer is learning a possibly non-linear function in that space. Now that we have converted our input image into a suitable form for our Multi-Level Perceptron, we shall flatten the image into a column vector. The flattened output is fed to a feed-forward neural network and backpropagation is applied to every iteration of training. Over a series of epochs, the model is able to distinguish between dominating and certain low-level features in images and classify them using the Softmax Classification technique. There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms which power and shall power AI as a whole in the foreseeable future.

3,What are Convolutional Neural Networks?  | IBM,"Skip to content IBM Cloud Learn Hub What are Convolutional Neural Networks? Convolutional Neural Networks By: IBM Cloud Education 20 October 2020 What are convolutional neural networks? How do convolutional neural networks work? Types of convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks and IBM Jump to ... What are convolutional neural networks? How do convolutional neural networks work? Types of convolutional neural networks Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks and IBM Convolutional Neural Networks Learn how convolutional neural networks use three-dimensional data to for image classification and object recognition tasks. What are convolutional neural networks? To reiterate from the Neural Networks Learn Hub article, neural networks are a subset of machine learning, and they are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. They are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network. While we primarily focused on feedforward networks in that article, there are various types of neural nets, which are used for different use cases and data types. For example, recurrent neural networks are commonly used for natural language processing and speech recognition whereas convolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are more often utilized for classification and computer vision tasks. Prior to CNNs, manual, time-consuming feature extraction methods were used to identify objects in images. However, convolutional neural networks now provide a more scalable approach to image classification and object recognition tasks, leveraging principles from linear algebra, specifically matrix multiplication, to identify patterns within an image. That said, they can be computationally demanding, requiring graphical processing units (GPUs) to train models. How do convolutional neural networks work? Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are: Convolutional layer Pooling layer Fully-connected (FC) layer The convolutional layer is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or pooling layers, the fully-connected layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object. Convolutional Layer The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are input data, a filter, and a feature map. Let’s assume that the input will be a color image, which is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D. This means that the input will have three dimensions—a height, width, and depth—which correspond to RGB in an image. We also have a feature detector, also known as a kernel or a filter, which will move across the receptive fields of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a convolution. The feature detector is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. While they can vary in size, the filter size is typically a 3x3 matrix; this also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the filter. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the filter shifts by a stride, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image. The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map, or a convolved feature. As you can see in the image above, each output value in the feature map does not have to connect to each pixel value in the input image. It only needs to connect to the receptive field, where the filter is being applied. Since the output array does not need to map directly to each input value, convolutional (and pooling) layers are commonly referred to as “partially connected” layers. However, this characteristic can also be described as local connectivity. Note that the weights in the feature detector remain fixed as it moves across the image, which is also known as parameter sharing. Some parameters, like the weight values, adjust during training through the process of backpropagation and gradient descent. However, there are three hyperparameters which affect the volume size of the output that need to be set before the training of the neural network begins. These include: 1. The number of filters affects the depth of the output. For example, three distinct filters would yield three different feature maps, creating a depth of three. 2. Stride is the distance, or number of pixels, that the kernel moves over the input matrix. While stride values of two or greater is rare, a larger stride yields a smaller output. 3. Zero-padding is usually used when the filters do not fit the input image. This sets all elements that fall outside of the input matrix to zero, producing a larger or equally sized output. There are three types of padding: Valid padding: This is also known as no padding. In this case, the last convolution is dropped if dimensions do not align. Same padding: This padding ensures that the output layer has the same size as the input layer Full padding: This type of padding increases the size of the output by adding zeros to the border of the input. After each convolution operation, a CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model. As we mentioned earlier, another convolution layer can follow the initial convolution layer. When this happens, the structure of the CNN can become hierarchical as the later layers can see the pixels within the receptive fields of prior layers.  As an example, let’s assume that we’re trying to determine if an image contains a bicycle. You can think of the bicycle as a sum of parts. It is comprised of a frame, handlebars, wheels, pedals, et cetera. Each individual part of the bicycle makes up a lower-level pattern in the neural net, and the combination of its parts represents a higher-level pattern, creating a feature hierarchy within the CNN. Ultimately, the convolutional layer converts the image into numerical values, allowing the neural network to interpret and extract relevant patterns. Pooling Layer Pooling layers, also known as downsampling, conducts dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of parameters in the input. Similar to the convolutional layer, the pooling operation sweeps a filter across the entire input, but the difference is that this filter does not have any weights. Instead, the kernel applies an aggregation function to the values within the receptive field, populating the output array. There are two main types of pooling: Max pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it selects the pixel with the maximum value to send to the output array. As an aside, this approach tends to be used more often compared to average pooling. Average pooling: As the filter moves across the input, it calculates the average value within the receptive field to send to the output array. While a lot of information is lost in the pooling layer, it also has a number of benefits to the CNN. They help to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and limit risk of overfitting. Fully-Connected Layer The name of the full-connected layer aptly describes itself. As mentioned earlier, the pixel values of the input image are not directly connected to the output layer in partially connected layers. However, in the fully-connected layer, each node in the output layer connects directly to a node in the previous layer. This layer performs the task of classification based on the features extracted through the previous layers and their different filters. While convolutional and pooling layers tend to use ReLu functions, FC layers usually leverage a softmax activation function to classify inputs appropriately, producing a probability from 0 to 1. Types of convolutional neural networks Kunihiko Fukushima and Yann LeCun laid the foundation of research around convolutional neural networks in their work in 1980 (PDF, 1.1 MB) (link resides outside IBM) and 1989 (PDF, 5.5 MB)(link resides outside of IBM), respectively. More famously, Yann LeCun successfully applied backpropagation to train neural networks to identify and recognize patterns within a series of handwritten zip codes. He would continue his research with his team throughout the 1990s, culminating with “LeNet-5”, (PDF, 933 KB) (link resides outside IBM), which applied the same principles of prior research to document recognition. Since then, a number of variant CNN architectures have emerged with the introduction of new datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10, and competitions, like ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Some of these other architectures include: AlexNet (PDF, 1.4 MB) (link resides outside IBM) VGGNet (PDF, 195 KB) (link resides outside IBM) GoogLeNet (PDF, 1.3 MB) (link resides outside IBM) ResNet (PDF, 800 KB) (link resides outside IBM) ZFNet However, LeNet-5 is known as the classic CNN architecture. Convolutional neural networks and computer vision Convolutional neural networks power image recognition and computer vision tasks. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs, and based on those inputs, it can take action. This ability to provide recommendations distinguishes it from image recognition tasks. Some common applications of this computer vision today can be seen in: Marketing: Social media platforms provide suggestions on who might be in photograph that has been posted on a profile, making it easier to tag friends in photo albums. Healthcare: Computer vision has been incorporated into radiology technology, enabling doctors to better identify cancerous tumors in healthy anatomy. Retail: Visual search has been incorporated into some e-commerce platforms, allowing brands to recommend items that would complement an existing wardrobe. Automotive : While the age of driverless cars hasn’t quite emerged, the underlying technology has started to make its way into automobiles, improving driver and passenger safety through features like lane line detection. Convolutional neural networks and IBM For decades now, IBM has been a pioneer in the development of AI technologies and neural networks, highlighted by the development and evolution of IBM Watson. Watson is now a trusted solution for enterprises looking to apply advanced visual recognition and deep learning techniques to their systems using a proven tiered approach to AI adoption and implementation. IBM’s Watson Visual Recognition makes it easy to extract thousands of labels from your organization’s images and detect for specific content out-of-the-box. You can also build custom models to detect for specific content in images inside your applications.

This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning. It can be hard to get your hands around what LSTMs are, and how terms like bidirectional and sequence-to-sequence relate to the field. In this post, you will get insight into LSTMs using the words of research scientists that developed the methods and applied them to new and important problems. There are few that are better at clearly and precisely articulating both the promise of LSTMs and how they work than the experts that developed them. We will explore key questions in the field of LSTMs using quotes from the experts, and if you’re interested, you will be able to dive into the original papers from which the quotes were taken. Kick-start your project with my new book Long Short-Term Memory Networks With Python , including step-by-step tutorials and the Python source code files for all examples. Let’s get started. A Gentle Introduction to Long Short-Term Memory Networks by the Experts Photo by Oran Viriyincy , some rights reserved. The Promise of Recurrent Neural Networks Recurrent neural networks are different from traditional feed-forward neural networks. This difference in the addition of complexity comes with the promise of new behaviors that the traditional methods cannot achieve. Recurrent networks … have an internal state that can represent context information. … [they] keep information about past inputs for an amount of time that is not fixed a priori, but rather depends on its weights and on the input data. … A recurrent network whose inputs are not fixed but rather constitute an input sequence can be used to transform an input sequence into an output sequence while taking into account contextual information in a flexible way. — Yoshua Bengio, et al., Learning Long-Term Dependencies with Gradient Descent is Difficult , 1994. The paper defines 3 basic requirements of a recurrent neural network: That the system be able to store information for an arbitrary duration. That the system be resistant to noise (i.e. fluctuations of the inputs that are random or irrelevant to predicting a correct output). That the system parameters be trainable (in reasonable time). The paper also describes the “minimal task” for demonstrating recurrent neural networks. Context is key. Recurrent neural networks must use context when making predictions, but to this extent, the context required must also be learned. … recurrent neural networks contain cycles that feed the network activations from a previous time step as inputs to the network to influence predictions at the current time step. These activations are stored in the internal states of the network which can in principle hold long-term temporal contextual information. This mechanism allows RNNs to exploit a dynamically changing contextual window over the input sequence history — Hassim Sak, et al., Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network Architectures for Large Scale Acoustic Modeling , 2014 Need help with LSTMs for Sequence Prediction?

LSTMs Deliver on the Promise The success of LSTMs is in their claim to be one of the first implements to overcome the technical problems and deliver on the promise of recurrent neural networks. Hence standard RNNs fail to learn in the presence of time lags greater than 5 – 10 discrete time steps between relevant input events and target signals. The vanishing error problem casts doubt on whether standard RNNs can indeed exhibit significant practical advantages over time window-based feedforward networks. A recent model, “Long Short-Term Memory” (LSTM), is not affected by this problem. LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error flow through “constant error carrousels” (CECs) within special units, called cells — Felix A. Gers, et al., Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM , 2000 The two technical problems overcome by LSTMs are vanishing gradients and exploding gradients, both related to how the network is trained. Unfortunately, the range of contextual information that standard RNNs can access is in practice quite limited. The problem is that the influence of a given input on the hidden layer, and therefore on the network output, either decays or blows up exponentially as it cycles around the network’s recurrent connections. This shortcoming … referred to in the literature as the vanishing gradient problem … Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. — Alex Graves, et al., A Novel Connectionist System for Unconstrained Handwriting Recognition , 2009 The key to the LSTM solution to the technical problems was the specific internal structure of the units used in the model. … governed by its ability to deal with vanishing and exploding gradients, the most common challenge in designing and training RNNs. To address this challenge, a particular form of recurrent nets, called LSTM, was introduced and applied with great success to translation and sequence generation. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. How do LSTMs Work? Rather than go into the equations that govern how LSTMs are fit, analogy is a useful tool to quickly get a handle on how they work. We use networks with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer… The (fully) self-connected hidden layer contains memory cells and corresponding gate units… … Each memory cell’s internal architecture guarantees constant error flow within its constant error carrousel CEC… This represents the basis for bridging very long time lags. Two gate units learn to open and close access to error flow within each memory cell’s CEC. The multiplicative input gate affords protection of the CEC from perturbation by irrelevant inputs. Likewise, the multiplicative output gate protects other units from perturbation by currently irrelevant memory contents. — Sepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber, Long Short-Term Memory , 1997. Multiple analogies can help to give purchase on what differentiates LSTMs from traditional neural networks comprised of simple neurons. The Long Short Term Memory architecture was motivated by an analysis of error flow in existing RNNs which found that long time lags were inaccessible to existing architectures, because backpropagated error either blows up or decays exponentially. An LSTM layer consists of a set of recurrently connected blocks, known as memory blocks. These blocks can be thought of as a differentiable version of the memory chips in a digital computer. Each one contains one or more recurrently connected memory cells and three multiplicative units – the input, output and forget gates – that provide continuous analogues of write, read and reset operations for the cells. … The net can only interact with the cells via the gates. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. It is interesting to note, that even after more than 20 years, the simple (or vanilla) LSTM may still be the best place to start when applying the technique. The most commonly used LSTM architecture (vanilla LSTM) performs reasonably well on various datasets… Learning rate and network size are the most crucial tunable LSTM hyperparameters … … This implies that the hyperparameters can be tuned independently. In particular, the learning rate can be calibrated first using a fairly small network, thus saving a lot of experimentation time. — Klaus Greff, et al., LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey , 2015 What are LSTM Applications? It is important to get a handle on exactly what type of sequence learning problems that LSTMs are suitable to address. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can solve numerous tasks not solvable by previous learning algorithms for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). … … LSTM holds promise for any sequential processing task in which we suspect that a hierarchical decomposition may exist, but do not know in advance what this decomposition is. — Felix A. Gers, et al., Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM , 2000 The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is neural sequence model that achieves state of the art performance on important tasks that include language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation. — Wojciech Zaremba, Recurrent Neural Network Regularization , 2014. Since LSTMs are effective at capturing long-term temporal dependencies without suffering from the optimization hurdles that plague simple recurrent networks (SRNs), they have been used to advance the state of the art for many difficult problems. This includes handwriting recognition and generation, language modeling and translation, acoustic modeling of speech, speech synthesis, protein secondary structure prediction, analysis of audio, and video data among others. — Klaus Greff, et al., LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey , 2015 What are Bidirectional LSTMs? A commonly mentioned improvement upon LSTMs are bidirectional LSTMs. The basic idea of bidirectional recurrent neural nets is to present each training sequence forwards and backwards to two separate recurrent nets, both of which are connected to the same output layer. … This means that for every point in a given sequence, the BRNN has complete, sequential information about all points before and after it. Also, because the net is free to use as much or as little of this context as necessary, there is no need to find a (task-dependent) time-window or target delay size. … for temporal problems like speech recognition, relying on knowledge of the future seems at first sight to violate causality … How can we base our understanding of what we’ve heard on something that hasn’t been said yet? However, human listeners do exactly that. Sounds, words, and even whole sentences that at first mean nothing are found to make sense in the light of future context. — Alex Graves, et al., Framewise Phoneme Classification with Bidirectional LSTM and Other Neural Network Architectures , 2005. One shortcoming of conventional RNNs is that they are only able to make use of previous context. … Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) do this by processing the data in both directions with two separate hidden layers, which are then fed forwards to the same output layer. … Combining BRNNs with LSTM gives bidirectional LSTM, which can access long-range context in both input directions — Alex Graves, et al., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks , 2013 Unlike conventional RNNs, bidirectional RNNs utilize both the previous and future context, by processing the data from two directions with two separate hidden layers. One layer processes the input sequence in the forward direction, while the other processes the input in the reverse direction. The output of current time step is then generated by combining both layers’ hidden vector… — Di Wang and Eric Nyberg, A Long Short-Term Memory Model for Answer Sentence Selection in Question Answering , 2015 What are seq2seq LSTMs or RNN Encoder-Decoders? The sequence-to-sequence LSTM, also called encoder-decoder LSTMs, are an application of LSTMs that are receiving a lot of attention given their impressive capability. … a straightforward application of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can solve general sequence to sequence problems. … The idea is to use one LSTM to read the input sequence, one timestep at a time, to obtain large fixed-dimensional vector representation, and then to use another LSTM to extract the output sequence from that vector. The second LSTM is essentially a recurrent neural network language model except that it is conditioned on the input sequence. The LSTM’s ability to successfully learn on data with long range temporal dependencies makes it a natural choice for this application due to the considerable time lag between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. We were able to do well on long sentences because we reversed the order of words in the source sentence but not the target sentences in the training and test set. By doing so, we introduced many short term dependencies that made the optimization problem much simpler. … The simple trick of reversing the words in the source sentence is one of the key technical contributions of this work — Ilya Sutskever, et al., Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks , 2014 An “encoder” RNN reads the source sentence and transforms it into a rich fixed-length vector representation, which in turn in used as the initial hidden state of a “decoder” RNN that generates the target sentence. Here, we propose to follow this elegant recipe, replacing the encoder RNN by a deep convolution neural network (CNN). … it is natural to use a CNN as an image “encoder”, by first pre-training it for an image classification task and using the last hidden layer as an input to the RNN decoder that generates sentences. — Oriol Vinyals, et al., Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator , 2014 … an RNN Encoder–Decoder, consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN) that act as an encoder and a decoder pair. The encoder maps a variable-length source sequence to a fixed-length vector, and the decoder maps the vector representation back to a variable-length target sequence. — Kyunghyun Cho, et al., Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation , 2014 Summary In this post, you received a gentle introduction to LSTMs in the words of the research scientists that developed and applied the techniques.

I think the first line of code refer to the hidden layers, how things get in? Reply Jason Brownlee July 11, 2017 at 10:39 am # These are not input layers, but are instead hidden layers. You must specify the size of the expected input as an argument “input_shape=(xx,xx)” on the first hidden layer. The input_shape specifies a tuple that specifies the number of time steps and features. A feature is the number of observations taken at each time step. See this post for more: https://machinelearningmastery.com/5-step-life-cycle-long-short-term-memory-models-keras/ Does that help?

Reply Long October 23, 2017 at 9:30 am # Hi Jason, layers.LSTM(units=4, activation=’tanh’, dropout=0.1)(lstm_input) what does the units here mean? I put the units here equals neurons number of hidden layer. Am I right? But if the input sequence is smaller than the number of the units here (i.e. blocks/neuron), does ir mean that some neurons in the lstm layer have not input series, just pass states to the next neurons? Thanks a lot. Reply Jason Brownlee October 23, 2017 at 4:11 pm # Yes, you are correct. No, one unit can have many inputs. Further, the RNN only takes one time step as input at a time. Reply Long October 23, 2017 at 6:21 pm # Hi Jason, I still confused about this topic. Let me say: 28 steps series are input the LSTM layer, while there are 128 neuron. Does it mean 100 neurons have not input at this situation, just pass previous states to the next neurons? Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43034960/many-to-one-and-many-to-many-lstm-examples-in-keras , the green rectangles represent the LSTM blocks/neuron in keras, which is 128. The pink rectangles represent the input series, which is 28. And the blue rectangles represent the output series. Thank you very much. Jason Brownlee October 24, 2017 at 5:28 am # No, the number of time steps and number of units are not related. Long October 24, 2017 at 9:39 am # Hi Jason, Thanks for your answer. When we use layers.LSTM(units=128, activation=’tanh’, dropout=0.1)(lstm_input) does we mean there are 128 units in A (depicted in http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/ )? If yes, what is the structure of such A like? Reply Jason Brownlee October 24, 2017 at 3:58 pm # 128 means 128 memory cells or neurons or what have you. I cannot speak to the pictures on another site. Perhaps contact their author? Reply Long October 25, 2017 at 1:06 pm # Thanks Jason. I just wanted to know the structure of the LSTM layer with 128 units, and the input and output. Reply Jason Brownlee October 25, 2017 at 4:04 pm # Generally, in Keras the shape of the input is defined by the output of the prior layer. The shape of the input to the network is specified on the visible layer or as an argument on the first hidden layer.

From the RNN unfolding description, I found that each RNN/LSTM cell take one time step at time. This part confuse me a lot. Can you please clarify me? Reply Jason Brownlee October 16, 2018 at 6:33 am # No, the number of units in the first hidden layer is unrelated to the number of times steps in the input data. Reply Abdullah Al Mamun May 4, 2019 at 2:18 pm # Hello sir, What are the differences between time steps and time lags? I’m confused about these two terms.

Reading about it further I understand that the hidden nodes count are usually matched to the dimension of the vectorized input (read as a word is represented by it’s embedding), but this is usually not the case. So given the latter, if hidden node count is lesser than the dimension of the input, what is the mapping between the two. (is it maybe fully connected?) Understanding this mapping can help me better understand how the LSTM learns as a whole.

I follow your website to learn different Machine Learning Concepts and techniques. I am currently working on Binary Classification problem where data contains logs recorded at any point of time. each log record has multiple features with label as Pass/Fail. I used LSTM for such sequence classification. I want to understand how LSTM works internally for sequence classification problem. Could you please suggest some references for that? Thank You Reply Jason Brownlee September 3, 2020 at 6:10 am # This will help as a first step: https://machinelearningmastery.com/faq/single-faq/how-is-data-processed-by-an-lstm Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 3, 2020 at 7:47 am # Thank you Jason for quick reply. Here is what I understood: each node in the layer will get one time step of input sequence at a time,process it and give one output label(for Sequence Classification). Output of last time step from end of sequence will be used further. I am still curious how output vector from all nodes will be used later in the processing. Could you please elaborate more on it? Reply Jason Brownlee September 3, 2020 at 1:41 pm # The entire vector of outputs from layer is passed to the next layer for consideration, if return_sequences is true, otherwise the output from the last time step is passed to the next layer. This applies for each node in the layer. Reply Jaiminee Kataria September 5, 2020 at 7:57 am # Thank You Jason. I understood. As I mentioned earlier, I am currently working on Binary classification problem. I have one more question. Dataset contains storage drives(unique id) with multiple heads(one drive will have multiple records/1:many), each head will have multiple records of events with different time(unit hour). We can say it is time series data. Here Label for each record is PASS/FAIL head. Below is the snapshot of dataset. drive head time feature1 label 1. 0. t1 x PASS 1. 0. t2. y PASS 1. 1. t1. z. PASS 1. 2. t1. p. PASS 1. 2. t2. w. PASS 2. 0. t1. x. FAIL 2. 0. t2. y. FAIL Our goal is to predict drive will fail within next X hour. If we can predict pass/fail head then we can combine all head prediction and maximum prediction will be prediction of drive. We first converted this tabular data into 3D sequences for each unique drive, used LSTM as LSTM requires input in shape of (samples, time steps, features) My question is while preparing sequence for LSTM, Should it be for each drive or for each head? Also, once we get head level prediction, is there any other way to get drive level prediction? Thank You. Jason Brownlee September 5, 2020 at 8:09 am # Yes, I think each drive would be one sample to train the model. Yes, you can make a prediction by calling model.predict() this will help: https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-predictions-long-short-term-memory-models-keras/ Jaiminee Kataria September 17, 2020 at 3:49 am # Thank You Jason. This article helped me in the process. As I started adding more data, I see that it is severe imbalance between major(negative) and minor(positive) class. I am aware that SMOTE and it’s variation are best way to handle imbalance data but I am not able to figure out how I can use SMOTE with LSTM time series binary classification. Could you please suggest some reference or other technique I should use with LSTM for imbalance data? Thank You. Reply Jason Brownlee September 17, 2020 at 6:51 am # SMOTE is not appropriate for sequence data. Perhaps try designing your own sequence data augmentation generator?

One short question: “A recurrent network whose inputs are not fixed but rather constitute an input sequence can be used to transform an input sequence into an output sequence while taking into account contextual information in a flexible way.” Why is a vanilla neural network restricted to a fixed input size, while a RNN is not? Could you elaborate on this with an example? Thanks a lot in advance! Reply Jason Brownlee February 5, 2021 at 5:43 am # You’re welcome. MLPs cannot take a sequence, instead we have to take each time step of the sequences as a “feature” with no time dimension. Reply Prakash M Nadkarni July 6, 2021 at 1:19 pm # Good article. In the part that quotes Hochreiter, “flow” is misspelled (twice) as “ow”. Reply Jason Brownlee July 7, 2021 at 5:29 am # Thanks. Fixed. Reply Lexy July 12, 2021 at 7:45 pm # This article is great, please can I get a practical example for behavioural prediction eg extrovert, introvert etc. I am trying to apply this concept to prediction problem but am entirely new to this field and I have limited time Reply Jason Brownlee July 13, 2021 at 5:17 am # Thanks for the suggestion. Perhaps you can adapt an example for your specific dataset: https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#lstm Reply Arnav Sharma December 25, 2021 at 7:10 am # “Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.” Error in this line: “older” not “order” Reply James Carmichael December 26, 2021 at 6:38 am # Thank you for the feedback Arnav!
